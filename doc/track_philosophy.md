# Phoenix Philosophy Track

The charter states that Phoenix should remain a small, transparent
research kernel.  Only minimal mechanisms live in the privileged core
while all policies reside in user space.

Key ideas include:

- Keep the kernel tiny and auditable.
- Build subsystems as separate libraries and drivers.
- Encourage experimentation by exposing raw capabilities.
- Document changes openly so others can reuse the work.

The philosophy drives the technical direction documented in the other
tracks.
