The mcu directory contains minimal startup code for 32-bit ARM Cortex-M targets.

Cross compilation is typically performed with the GCC toolchain distributed as
``arm-none-eabi-gcc``.  Configure the build with MCU support and select the
cross compiler, for example::

    cmake -S ../.. -B build -G Ninja -DMCU=ON \
        -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=arm-none-eabi-gcc

Or with Meson::

    meson setup build -Dmcu=true --cross-file your-cross-file

The resulting ``kernel`` image can be flashed to a suitable microcontroller
board.
