The mcu directory contains minimal startup code for 32-bit ARM Cortex-M targets.

Cross compilation is typically performed with the GCC toolchain distributed as
``arm-none-eabi-gcc``.  Configure the build with MCU support and select the
cross compiler, for example::

    meson setup build -Dmcu=true --cross-file your-cross-file

Note: CMake support has been removed; use Meson exclusively.

The resulting ``kernel`` image can be flashed to a suitable microcontroller
board.
