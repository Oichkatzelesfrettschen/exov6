Background Process Group</a>).</p>
<p>In the context of the shell, a job that the shell is not waiting for before it executes further commands or, if interactive,
prompts for further commands. A background job can be a job-control background job or a non-job-control background job. A
job-control background job is a job that started execution (either in the background or the foreground) while job control was
enabled and is currently in the background. A non-job-control background job is an asynchronous AND-OR list that started execution
while job control was disabled and was assigned a job number. An implementation need not support non-job-control background jobs;
that is, the shell may, but need not, assign job numbers to asynchronous AND-OR lists that start execution while job control is
disabled. <basefont size="2"></p>

<p>The smallest entity used to determine the logical ordering of character or wide-character strings; see also <a href=

<p>The relative order of collating elements as determined by the setting of the <i>LC_COLLATE</i> category in the current locale.
The collation sequence is used for sorting and is determined from the collating weights assigned to each collating element. In the
absence of weights, the collation sequence is the order in which collating elements are specified between <b>order_start</b> and

<p>Multi-level sorting is accomplished by assigning elements one or more collation weights, up to the limit {COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX}. On
each level, elements may be given the same weight (at the primary level, called an equivalence class; see also <a href=

owning open file description is inherited these locks remain in effect. OFD-owned file locks are automatically released on the last
close of the open file description. These locks are only shared among file descriptors associated with the same open file
description. Thus, a multi-threaded process can use multiple open file descriptions (such as by <a href=

separated by &lt;slash&gt; characters. A pathname can optionally contain one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters. Multiple
successive &lt;slash&gt; characters are considered to be the same as one &lt;slash&gt;, except it is implementation-defined whether

character, the pathname will be usable as a character string in all supported locales; otherwise, the pathname might only be a
string (rather than a character string). Additionally, since the single-byte encoding of the &lt;slash&gt; character is required to
be the same across all locales and to not occur within a multi-byte character, references to a &lt;slash&gt; character within a
pathname are well-defined even when the pathname is not a character string. However, this property does not necessarily hold for
the remaining characters within the portable filename character set.

across the <i>exec</i> family of functions. A process-owned file lock is released when the process exits, or when any file
descriptor in the process referring to the same file is closed (even if via a different open file description). These locks are
shared among all open file descriptions referring to the same file in the process, making the use of process-owned file locks
unsuitable for use for coordination of record access among multiple threads in a process.</p>
