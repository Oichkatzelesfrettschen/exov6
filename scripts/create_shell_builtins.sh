# POSIX Shell Builtins

These utilities are primarily shell builtins but POSIX requires them
as standalone utilities for compliance:

## Job Control
- bg: Resume jobs in background
- fg: Resume jobs in foreground  
- jobs: Display job status

## Shell Environment
- alias: Define/display aliases
- eval: Construct and execute commands
- exec: Execute commands
- exit: Exit shell
- export: Set export attribute
- set: Set shell options
- trap: Trap signals
- ulimit: Set resource limits
- unset: Unset values
- type: Write command type
- command: Execute simple command

## Other Required Utilities
- locale: Locale information
- asa: FORTRAN carriage control
- c17: C compiler interface
- ctags: Create tags
- gencat: Message catalogs
- more: Pager
- vi: Visual editor

Note: In our exokernel, these are implemented as stub utilities
that would normally be handled by the shell or libos.
