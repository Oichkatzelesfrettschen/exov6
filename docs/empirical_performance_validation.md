# Empirical Performance Validation Roadmap

This document outlines the methodology and roadmap for empirically validating the analytical performance bounds of the FeuerBird exokernel.

## 1. Introduction

Analytical performance models provide a theoretical understanding of system behavior. However, real-world performance can be influenced by various factors not captured in theoretical models, such as hardware specifics, cache effects, and contention. This roadmap details the steps to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and observed performance.

## 2. Methodology

Empirical validation will involve a systematic approach to benchmarking, data collection, and analysis.

### 2.1. Testbed Setup

- **Hardware:** Utilize a dedicated testbed with consistent hardware specifications (CPU, memory, storage, network interfaces) to ensure reproducible results.
- **Software Environment:** Standardize the build environment, compiler versions, and kernel configurations.
- **Instrumentation:** Implement kernel-level and user-level instrumentation (e.g., high-resolution timers, performance counters, tracing mechanisms) to collect fine-grained performance data.

### 2.2. Benchmark Categories

Benchmarks will be categorized to target specific aspects of kernel performance:

- **Microbenchmarks:** Focus on the performance of individual kernel primitives and operations.
    - **System Calls:** Measure latency and throughput of `exo_alloc_page`, `exo_send`, `exo_yield_to`, etc.
    - **IPC:** Measure latency and throughput of `exo_send`/`exo_recv` for various message sizes, both within a single CPU and across multiple CPUs.
    - **Context Switches:** Measure the overhead of `exo_yield_to` and scheduler context switches.
    - **Memory Operations:** Measure latency of `exo_alloc_page`/`exo_unbind_page` and performance of zone allocator operations.
    - **Interrupt Handling:** Measure interrupt latency and jitter.
    - **Capability Operations:** Measure performance of `cap_table_alloc`, `cap_table_lookup`, `cap_revoke`.

- **Macrobenchmarks:** Evaluate the performance of higher-level system functionalities and applications.
    - **User-Space Drivers:** Measure throughput and latency of user-space block and network drivers.
    - **POSIX Workloads:** Run standard POSIX benchmarks (e.g., `lmbench`, `phoronix-test-suite`) on the LibOS.
    - **Real-Time Workloads:** Execute synthetic or real-world real-time applications to assess determinism and deadline adherence.

### 2.3. Data Collection and Analysis

- **Data Points:** Collect metrics such as execution time, CPU cycles, cache misses, and memory usage.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Employ statistical methods to analyze benchmark results, including mean, median, standard deviation, and percentile analysis to understand performance distribution and variability.
- **Comparison with Analytical Bounds:** Directly compare empirical results with the analytical performance bounds to identify discrepancies and refine the theoretical models.

## 3. Tools and Infrastructure

- **Benchmarking Framework:** Develop or adapt a robust benchmarking framework to automate test execution and data collection.
- **Visualization Tools:** Utilize tools like `gnuplot`, `matplotlib`, or custom scripts to visualize performance data and trends.
- **Tracing and Profiling:** Employ kernel tracing tools (if available) and CPU profilers to identify performance hotspots and bottlenecks.

## 4. Future Work

- **Automated CI Integration:** Integrate empirical benchmarks into the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to track performance regressions.
- **Workload Characterization:** Develop representative workloads that accurately reflect the demands of target applications (e.g., real-time control systems, high-performance computing).
- **Power Consumption Analysis:** Extend benchmarking to include power consumption metrics for energy-efficient designs.

This roadmap will guide the systematic validation of FeuerBird's performance, ensuring it meets the stringent requirements of high-performance and real-time applications.
