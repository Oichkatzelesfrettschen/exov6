# Contribution Guidelines

All modifications must strive for modern, idiomatic code using clear functional decomposition. When editing or adding code, unroll deeply nested logic, flatten complex loops, and refactor into concise functions guided by mathematical reasoning. Every function must be documented with Doxygen style comments.

Documentation should remain synchronized with the code. Run `doxygen docs/Doxyfile` and `make -C docs/sphinx` to ensure the documentation builds.
