# Games

This directory contains standalone C implementations of classic
terminal games. The code is intentionally independent from the rest
of the repository so it can be compiled and run on its own.

## wumpus

An implementation of the vintage *Hunt the Wumpus* game. Build with:

```sh
cc -O2 wumpus.c -o wumpus
```

Run `./wumpus` to play.
