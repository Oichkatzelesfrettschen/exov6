<h2><a name="tag_01" id="tag_01"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<h3><a name="tag_01_01" id="tag_01_01"></a>1.1 Scope</h3>
<p>POSIX.1-2024 defines a standard operating system interface and environment, including a command interpreter (or &quot;shell&quot;), and
common utility programs to support applications portability at the source code level. It is intended to be used by both application
developers and system implementors.</p>
<p>POSIX.1-2024 comprises four major components (each in an associated volume):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>General terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of POSIX.1-2024, including utility conventions and C-language
header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitions for system service functions and subroutines, language-specific system services for the C programming language,
function issues, including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1-2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitions for a standard source code-level interface to command interpretation services (a &quot;shell&quot;) and common utility
programs for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1-2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document structure, containing historical information concerning
the contents of POSIX.1-2024 and why features were included or discarded by the standard developers, is included in the Rationale
(Informative) volume of POSIX.1-2024.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following areas are outside of the scope of POSIX.1-2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Graphics interfaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database management system interfaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record I/O considerations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object or binary code portability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System configuration and resource availability</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>POSIX.1-2024 describes the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance to application developers, rather than
the internal construction techniques employed to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions and
facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications.</p>
<p>The facilities provided in POSIX.1-2024 are drawn from the following base documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 (POSIX.1-2017)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IEEE Std 1003.26-2003 (POSIX.26-2003)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISO/IEC 9899:2018, Programming Languages — C (C17)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISO/IEC TR 24731-2:2010, Programming languages, their environments and system software interfaces — Extensions to the C library
— Part 2: Dynamic Allocation Functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Open Group Standard, 2021, Additional APIs for the Base Specifications Issue 8, Part 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Open Group Standard, 2022, Additional APIs for the Base Specifications Issue 8, Part 2</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Emphasis has been placed on standardizing existing practice for existing users, with changes and additions limited to correcting
deficiencies in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Issues raised by Austin Group defect reports and IEEE Interpretations against IEEE Std 1003.1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issues raised in corrigenda for The Open Group Standards and working group resolutions from The Open Group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to make the text self-consistent with the additional material merged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features, marked obsolescent in the base documents, have been considered for removal in this version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alignment with the ISO/IEC 9899:2018 standard</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="tag_01_02" id="tag_01_02"></a>1.2 Word Usage</h3>
<p>The word <i>shall</i> indicates mandatory requirements strictly to be followed in order to conform to the standard and from
which no deviation is permitted (<i>shall</i> equals <i>is required to</i>). <a href=
"#tag_foot_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a><small><sup>,</sup></small> <a href="#tag_foot_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a></p>
<p>The word <i>should</i> indicates that among several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without
mentioning or excluding others; or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required (<i>should</i> equals
<i>is recommended that</i>).</p>
<p>The word <i>may</i> is used to indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the standard (<i>may</i> equals
<i>is permitted to</i>).</p>
<p>The word <i>can</i> is used for statements of possibility and capability, whether material, physical, or causal (<i>can</i>
equals <i>is able to</i>).</p>

<h3><a name="tag_01_05" id="tag_01_05"></a>1.5 Change History</h3>
<p>Change history is described in the Rationale (Informative) volume of POSIX.1-2024, and in the CHANGE HISTORY section of
reference pages.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_01_06" id="tag_01_06"></a>1.6 Terminology</h3>
<p>For the purposes of POSIX.1-2024, the following terminology definitions apply:</p>
<h4 class="term"><a name="tag_01_06_01" id="tag_01_06_01"></a>can</h4>
<p>Describes a permissible optional feature or behavior available to the user or application. The feature or behavior is mandatory
for an implementation that conforms to POSIX.1-2024. An application can rely on the existence of the feature or behavior.</p>
<h4 class="term"><a name="tag_01_06_02" id="tag_01_06_02"></a>implementation-defined</h4>
<p>Describes a value or behavior that is not defined by POSIX.1-2024 but is selected by an implementor. The value or behavior may
vary among implementations that conform to POSIX.1-2024. An application should not rely on the existence of the value or behavior.
An application that relies on such a value or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.</p>
<p>The implementor shall document such a value or behavior so that it can be used correctly by an application.</p>
<h4 class="term"><a name="tag_01_06_03" id="tag_01_06_03"></a>legacy</h4>
<p>Describes a feature or behavior that is being retained for compatibility with older applications, but which has limitations
which make it inappropriate for developing portable applications. New applications should use alternative means of obtaining
equivalent functionality.</p>
<h4 class="term"><a name="tag_01_06_04" id="tag_01_06_04"></a>may</h4>
<p>Describes a feature or behavior that is optional for an implementation that conforms to POSIX.1-2024. An application should not
rely on the existence of the feature or behavior. An application that relies on such a feature or behavior cannot be assured to be
portable across conforming implementations.</p>
<p>To avoid ambiguity, the opposite of <i>may</i> is expressed as <i>need not</i>, instead of <i>may not</i>.</p>
<h4 class="term"><a name="tag_01_06_05" id="tag_01_06_05"></a>shall</h4>
<p>For an implementation that conforms to POSIX.1-2024, describes a feature or behavior that is mandatory. An application can rely
on the existence of the feature or behavior.</p>
<p>For an application or user, describes a behavior that is mandatory.</p>
<h4 class="term"><a name="tag_01_06_06" id="tag_01_06_06"></a>should</h4>
<p>For an implementation that conforms to POSIX.1-2024, describes a feature or behavior that is recommended but not mandatory. An
application should not rely on the existence of the feature or behavior. An application that relies on such a feature or behavior
cannot be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.</p>
<p>For an application, describes a feature or behavior that is recommended programming practice for optimum portability.</p>
<h4 class="term"><a name="tag_01_06_07" id="tag_01_06_07"></a>undefined</h4>
<p>Describes the nature of a value or behavior not defined by POSIX.1-2024 which results from use of an invalid program construct
or invalid data input.</p>
<p>The value or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to POSIX.1-2024. An application should not rely on the
existence or validity of the value or behavior. An application that relies on any particular value or behavior cannot be assured to
be portable across conforming implementations.</p>
<h4 class="term"><a name="tag_01_06_08" id="tag_01_06_08"></a>unspecified</h4>
<p>Describes the nature of a value or behavior not specified by POSIX.1-2024 which results from use of a valid program construct or
valid data input.</p>
<p>The value or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to POSIX.1-2024. An application should not rely on the
existence or validity of the value or behavior. An application that relies on any particular value or behavior cannot be assured to
be portable across conforming implementations.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_01_07" id="tag_01_07"></a>1.7 Definitions and Concepts</h3>
<p>Definitions and concepts are defined in <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03"><i>3. Definitions</i></a> and <a href=
"../basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04"><i>4. General Concepts</i></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_01_08" id="tag_01_08"></a>1.8 Portability</h3>
<p>Some of the utilities in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1-2024 and functions in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1-2024 describe functionality that might not be fully portable to systems meeting the requirements for POSIX conformance (see
<a href="../basedefs/V1_chap02.html#tag_02"><i>2. Conformance</i></a>).</p>
<p>Where optional, enhanced, or reduced functionality is specified, the text is shaded and a code in the margin identifies the
nature of the option, extension, or warning (see <a href="#tag_01_08_01">1.8.1 Codes</a>). For maximum portability, an application
should avoid such functionality.</p>
<p>Unless the primary task of a utility is to produce textual material on its standard output, application developers should not
rely on the format or content of any such material that may be produced. Where the primary task <i>is</i> to provide such material,
but the output format is incompletely specified, the description is marked with the OF margin code and shading. Application
developers are warned not to expect that the output of such an interface on one system is any guide to its behavior on another
system.</p>
<h4><a name="tag_01_08_01" id="tag_01_08_01"></a>1.8.1 Codes</h4>
<p>The codes and their meanings are as follows. See also <a href="#tag_01_08_02">1.8.2 Margin Code Notation</a>.</p>

Extension to the ISO&nbsp;C standard <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"><br>
The functionality described is an extension to the ISO&nbsp;C standard or a deviation from it. Application developers can make use
of the functionality as it is supported on all POSIX.1-2024-conforming systems.</p>
<p>With each function or header from the ISO&nbsp;C standard, a statement is included to the effect that &quot;any conflict is
unintentional&quot;, or &quot;any other conflict is unintentional&quot; if there is an intentional conflict (deviation). That is intended to
refer to a direct conflict. POSIX.1-2024 acts in part as a profile of the ISO&nbsp;C standard, and it may choose to further
constrain behaviors allowed to vary by the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Such limitations and other compatible differences are not
considered conflicts, even if a CX mark is missing. The markings are for information only.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_08_02" id="tag_01_08_02"></a>1.8.2 Margin Code Notation</h4>
<p>Some of the functionality described in POSIX.1-2024 depends on support of more than one option, or independently may depend on
several options. The following notation for margin codes is used to denote the following cases.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_01_08_02_01" id="tag_01_08_02_01"></a>A Feature Dependent on One or Two Options</h5>
<p>In this case, margin codes have a &lt;space&gt; separator; for example:</p>
<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('SHM')">SHM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
This feature requires support for only the Shared Memory Objects option. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]"
border="0"></p>
<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('SHM%20TYM')">SHM TYM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]"
border="0"> This feature requires support for both the Shared Memory Objects option and the Typed Memory Objects option; that is,
an application which uses this feature is portable only between implementations that provide both options. <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>
<h5><a name="tag_01_08_02_02" id="tag_01_08_02_02"></a>A Feature Dependent on Either of the Options Denoted</h5>
<p>In this case, margin codes have a <tt>'|'</tt> separator to denote the logical OR; for example:</p>
<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('SHM')">SHM|TYM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border=
"0"> This feature is dependent on support for either the Shared Memory Objects option or the Typed Memory Objects option; that is,
an application which uses this feature is portable between implementations that provide any (or all) of the options. <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>
<h5><a name="tag_01_08_02_03" id="tag_01_08_02_03"></a>A Feature Dependent on More than Two Options</h5>
<p>The following shorthand notations are used:</p>
<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('MC1')">MC1</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
The MC1 margin code is shorthand for TPP|TPI|RPP|RPI. Features which are shaded with this margin code require support of either the
Non-Robust Mutex Priority Protection option or the Non-Robust Mutex Priority Inheritance option or the Robust Mutex Priority
Protection option or the Robust Mutex Priority Inheritance option. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border=
"0"></p>
<h5><a name="tag_01_08_02_04" id="tag_01_08_02_04"></a>Large Sections Dependent on an Option</h5>
<p>Where large sections of text are dependent on support for an option, a lead-in text block is provided and shaded accordingly;
for example:</p>
<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
This section describes extensions to support interprocess communication. The functionality described in this section shall be
provided on implementations that support the XSI option (and the rest of this section is not further marked). <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>
