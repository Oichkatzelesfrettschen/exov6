<h3><a name="tag_04_01" id="tag_04_01"></a>4.1 Case Insensitive Comparisons</h3>
<p>When a standard utility or function that uses regular expressions or pattern matching specifies that matching shall be case
insensitive, then if a string would match the regular expression or pattern when doing a case-sensitive match, the same string with
any of its characters replaced with their case counterparts, as defined by the <b>toupper</b> and <b>tolower</b> character mappings
(see <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap07.html#tag_07_03_01"><i>7.3.1 LC_CTYPE</i></a>), shall also match when doing a case-insensitive
match.</p>
<p>This definition of case-insensitive processing is intended to allow matching of multi-character collating elements as well as
characters, as each character in the string is matched using both its cases. For example, in a locale with a <tt>"Ch"</tt>
multi-character collating element (see <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap07.html#tag_07_03_02"><i>7.3.2 LC_COLLATE</i></a>), the bracket
expression <tt>"[[.Ch.]]"</tt> (see <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap09.html#tag_09_03_05"><i>9.3.5 RE Bracket Expression</i></a> item
4) matches the strings <tt>"ch"</tt>, <tt>"Ch"</tt>, <tt>"cH"</tt>, and <tt>"CH"</tt> when matching without regard to case.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_02" id="tag_04_02"></a>4.2 Concurrent Execution</h3>
<p>Functions that suspend the execution of the calling thread shall not cause the execution of other threads to be indefinitely
suspended.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_03" id="tag_04_03"></a>4.3 Default Initialization</h3>
<p>Default initialization causes an object to be initialized according to these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it has pointer type, it is initialized to a null pointer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to (positive or unsigned) zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is an aggregate, every member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is a union, the first named member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For an object of aggregate type with an explicit initializer, the initialization shall occur in initializer list order, each
initializer provided for a particular subobject overriding any previously listed initializer for the same subobject; all subobjects
that are not initialized explicitly shall be initialized implicitly according to the rules for default initialization.</p>
<p>Objects with static storage duration but no explicit initializer shall be initialized implicitly according to the rules for
default initialization.</p>
<p>An explicit initializer of <tt>{ 0 }</tt> works to perform explicit default initialization for any object of scalar or aggregate
type, and for any storage duration. <basefont size="2"></p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Notes:</b></dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The ISO&nbsp;C standard does not require a compiler to set any field alignment padding bits in a structure or array definition
to a particular value. Because of this, a structure initialized using <tt>{ 0 }</tt> might not <a href=
"../functions/memcmp.html"><i>memcmp</i>()</a> as equal to the same structure initialized using <a href=
"../functions/memset.html"><i>memset</i>()</a> to zero. For consistent results, portable applications comparing structures should
test each field individually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an implementation treats the all-zero bit pattern of a floating-point object as equivalent to positive 0, then <a href=
"../functions/memset.html"><i>memset</i>()</a> to zero and <a href="../functions/calloc.html"><i>calloc</i>()</a> have the same
effects as default initialization for all named members of a structure. Implementations that define __STDC_IEC_559__ guarantee that
the all-zero bit pattern of a floating-point object represents 0.0.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_04" id="tag_04_04"></a>4.4 Directory Operations</h3>
<p>All file system operations that read or search a directory or that modify the contents of a directory (for example creating,
unlinking, or renaming a file) shall operate atomically. That is, each operation shall either have its entire effect and succeed,
or shall not affect the file system and shall fail. Furthermore, these operations shall be serializable; that is, the state of the
file system and of the results of each operation shall always be values that would be obtained if the operations were executed one
after the other.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_05" id="tag_04_05"></a>4.5 Directory Protection</h3>
<p>If a directory is writable and the mode bit S_ISVTX is set on the directory, a process may remove or rename files within that
directory only if one or more of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The effective user ID of the process is the same as that of the owner ID of the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effective user ID of the process is the same as that of the owner ID of the directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process has appropriate privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, the file is writable by the process. Whether or not files that are writable by the process can be removed or renamed
is implementation-defined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the S_ISVTX bit is set on a non-directory file, the behavior is unspecified.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_06" id="tag_04_06"></a>4.6 Extended Security Controls</h3>
<p>An implementation may provide implementation-defined extended security controls (see <a href=
"../basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_135"><i>3.135 Extended Security Controls</i></a>). These permit an implementation to provide
security mechanisms to implement different security policies than those described in POSIX.1-2024. These mechanisms shall not alter
or override the defined semantics of any of the interfaces in POSIX.1-2024.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_07" id="tag_04_07"></a>4.7 File Access Permissions</h3>
<p>The standard file access control mechanism uses the file permission bits, as described below.</p>
<p>Implementations may provide <i>additional</i> or <i>alternate</i> file access control mechanisms, or both. An additional access
control mechanism shall only further restrict the access permissions defined by the file permission bits. An alternate file access
control mechanism shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Specify file permission bits for the file owner class, file group class, and file other class of that file, corresponding to the
access permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be enabled only by explicit user action, on a per-file basis by the file owner or a user with appropriate privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be disabled for a file after the file permission bits are changed for that file with <a href=
"../functions/chmod.html"><i>chmod</i>()</a>. The disabling of the alternate mechanism need not disable any additional mechanisms
supported by an implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever a process requests file access permission for read, write, or execute/search, if no additional mechanism denies access,
access shall be determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a process has appropriate privileges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If read, write, or directory search permission is requested, access shall be granted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If execute permission is requested, access shall be granted if execute permission is granted to at least one user by the file
permission bits or by an alternate access control mechanism; otherwise, access shall be denied.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The file permission bits of a file contain read, write, and execute/search permissions for the file owner class, file group
class, and file other class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access shall be granted if an alternate access control mechanism is not enabled and the requested access permission bit is set
for the class (file owner class, file group class, or file other class) to which the process belongs, or if an alternate access
control mechanism is enabled and it allows the requested access; otherwise, access shall be denied.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="tag_04_08" id="tag_04_08"></a>4.8 File Hierarchy</h3>
<p>Files in the system are organized in a hierarchical structure in which all of the non-terminal nodes are directories and all of
the terminal nodes are any other type of file. Since multiple directory entries may refer to the same file, the hierarchy is
properly described as a &quot;directed graph&quot;.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_09" id="tag_04_09"></a>4.9 Filenames</h3>
<p>Uppercase and lowercase letters shall retain their unique identities between conforming implementations.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_10" id="tag_04_10"></a>4.10 Filename Portability</h3>
<p>For a filename to be portable across implementations conforming to POSIX.1-2024, it shall consist only of the portable filename
character set as defined in <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_265"><i>3.265 Portable Filename Character Set</i></a>.
<basefont size="2"></p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>Applications should avoid using filenames that have the &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character as the first character since this may
cause problems when filenames are passed as command line arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<basefont size="3">
<h3><a name="tag_04_11" id="tag_04_11"></a>4.11 File System Cache</h3>
<p>If the file system is accessed via a memory cache, file-related requirements stated in the rest of this standard shall apply to
the cache, except where explicitly stated otherwise: this includes directory atomicity and serializability requirements (see
<a href="#tag_04_04">4.4 Directory Operations</a>), file times update requirements (see <a href="#tag_04_12">4.12 File Times
Update</a>), and read-write serializability requirements (see <a href="../functions/write.html#tag_17_699"><i>write</i>()</a>).
Cache entries shall be transferred to the underlying storage as the result of successful calls to <a href=
"../functions/fdatasync.html"><i>fdatasync</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fsync.html"><i>fsync</i>()</a>, or <a href=
"../functions/aio_fsync.html"><i>aio_fsync</i>()</a>, and may be transferred to storage automatically at other times. Such
transfers shall be atomic, with minimum units being directory entries (for directory contents), aligned data blocks of the
fundamental file system block size (for regular-file contents; see <a href=
"../basedefs/sys_statvfs.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/statvfs.h&gt;</i></a>), and all attributes of a single file (for file attributes).
<basefont size="2"></p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>If the system crashes before the cache is fully transferred, later operations' effects may be present in storage with earlier
effects missing.</dd>
</dl>
<basefont size="3"> <basefont size="2">
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>Operations that create or modify multiple directory entries, aligned data blocks, or file attributes (e.g., <a href=
"../functions/mkdir.html"><i>mkdir</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/rename.html"><i>rename</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> with large buffer size, <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> with
O_CREAT) may have only part of their effects transferred to storage, and after a crash these operations may appear to have been
only partly done, with the parts not necessarily done in any order. For example, only the second half of a <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> may be transferred; or <tt>rename("a","b")</tt> may result in <b>b</b> being created
without <b>a</b> being removed.</dd>
</dl>
<basefont size="3"> <basefont size="2">
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>Although conforming file systems are required to perform all caching as described above, some file systems may support
non-conforming configurations (for example via mount options) for which this is not the case. Applications that are used on
non-conforming file systems cannot rely on files being synchronized properly.</dd>
</dl>
<basefont size="3">
<h3><a name="tag_04_12" id="tag_04_12"></a>4.12 File Times Update</h3>
<p>Many operations have requirements to update file timestamps. These requirements do not apply to streams that have no underlying
file description (for example, memory streams created by <a href="../functions/open_memstream.html"><i>open_memstream</i>()</a>
have no underlying file description).</p>
<p>Each file has three distinct associated timestamps: the time of last data access, the time of last data modification, and the
time the file status last changed. These values are returned in the file characteristics structure <b>struct stat</b>, as described
in <a href="../basedefs/sys_stat.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</i></a>.</p>
<p>Each function or utility in POSIX.1-2024 that reads or writes data (even if the data does not change) or performs an operation
to change file status (even if the file status does not change) indicates which of the appropriate timestamps shall be marked for
update. If an implementation of such a function or utility marks for update one of these timestamps in a place or time not
specified by POSIX.1-2024, this shall be documented, except that any changes caused by pathname resolution need not be documented.
For the other functions or utilities in POSIX.1-2024 (those that are not explicitly required to read or write file data or change
file status, but that in some implementations happen to do so), the effect is unspecified.</p>
<p>An implementation may update timestamps that are marked for update immediately, or it may update such timestamps periodically.
At the point in time when an update occurs, any marked timestamps shall be set to the current time and the update marks shall be
cleared. All timestamps that are marked for update shall be updated when the file ceases to be open by any process or before a
<a href="../functions/fstat.html"><i>fstat</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fstatat.html"><i>fstatat</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/fsync.html"><i>fsync</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/futimens.html"><i>futimens</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/lstat.html"><i>lstat</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/stat.html"><i>stat</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/utimensat.html"><i>utimensat</i>()</a>, or <a href="../functions/utimes.html"><i>utimes</i>()</a> is successfully
performed on the file. Other times at which updates are done are unspecified. Marks for update, and updates themselves, shall not
be done for files on read-only file systems; see <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_295"><i>3.295 Read-Only File
System</i></a>.</p>
<p>The resolution of timestamps of files in a file system is implementation-defined, but shall be no coarser than one-second
resolution. The three timestamps shall always have values that are supported by the file system. Whenever any of a file's
timestamps are to be set to a value <i>V</i> according to the rules of the preceding paragraphs of this section, the implementation
shall immediately set the timestamp to the greatest value supported by the file system that is not greater than <i>V</i>.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_13" id="tag_04_13"></a>4.13 Host and Network Byte Orders</h3>
<p>When data is transmitted over the network, it is sent as a sequence of octets (8-bit unsigned values). If an entity (such as an
address or a port number) can be larger than 8 bits, it needs to be stored in several octets. The convention is that all such
values are stored with 8 bits in each octet, and with the first (lowest-addressed) octet holding the most-significant bits. This is
called &quot;network byte order&quot;.</p>
<p>Network byte order may not be convenient for processing actual values. For this, it is more sensible for values to be stored as
ordinary integers. This is known as &quot;host byte order&quot;. In host byte order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The most significant bit might not be stored in the first byte in address order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bits might not be allocated to bytes in any obvious order at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>8-bit values stored in <b>uint8_t</b> objects do not require conversion to or from host byte order, as they have the same
representation. 16 and 32-bit values can be converted using the <a href="../functions/htonl.html"><i>htonl</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/htons.html"><i>htons</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/ntohl.html"><i>ntohl</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/ntohs.html"><i>ntohs</i>()</a> functions. When reading data that is to be converted to host byte order, it should
either be received directly into a <b>uint16_t</b> or <b>uint32_t</b> object or should be copied from an array of bytes using
<a href="../functions/memcpy.html"><i>memcpy</i>()</a> or similar. Passing the data through other types could cause the byte order
to be changed. Similar considerations apply when sending data.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_14" id="tag_04_14"></a>4.14 Measurement of Execution Time</h3>
<p>The mechanism used to measure execution time shall be implementation-defined. The implementation shall also define to whom the
CPU time that is consumed by interrupt handlers and system services on behalf of the operating system will be charged. See <a href=
"../basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_90"><i>3.90 CPU Time (Execution Time)</i></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_15" id="tag_04_15"></a>4.15 Memory Ordering and Synchronization</h3>
<h4><a name="tag_04_15_01" id="tag_04_15_01"></a>4.15.1 Memory Ordering</h4>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_04_15_01_01" id="tag_04_15_01_01"></a>4.15.1.1 Data Races</h5>
<p>The value of an object visible to a thread <i>T</i> at a particular point is the initial value of the object, a value stored in
the object by <i>T</i>, or a value stored in the object by another thread, according to the rules below.</p>
<p>Two expression evaluations <i>conflict</i> if one of them modifies a memory location and the other one reads or modifies the
same memory location.</p>
<p>This standard defines a number of atomic operations (see <a href="../basedefs/stdatomic.h.html"><i>&lt;stdatomic.h&gt;</i></a>)
and operations on mutexes (see <a href="../basedefs/threads.h.html"><i>&lt;threads.h&gt;</i></a>) that are specially identified as
synchronization operations. These operations play a special role in making assignments in one thread visible to another. A
synchronization operation on one or more memory locations is either an <i>acquire operation</i>, a <i>release operation</i>, both
an acquire and release operation, or a <i>consume operation</i>. A synchronization operation without an associated memory location
is a <i>fence</i> and can be either an acquire fence, a release fence, or both an acquire and release fence. In addition, there are
<i>relaxed atomic operations</i>, which are not synchronization operations, and atomic <i>read-modify-write operations</i>, which
have special characteristics. <basefont size="2"></p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>For example, a call that acquires a mutex will perform an acquire operation on the locations composing the mutex.
Correspondingly, a call that releases the same mutex will perform a release operation on those same locations. Informally,
performing a release operation on <i>A</i> forces prior side effects on other memory locations to become visible to other threads
that later perform an acquire or consume operation on <i>A</i>. Relaxed atomic operations are not included as synchronization
operations although, like synchronization operations, they cannot contribute to data races.</dd>
</dl>
<basefont size="3">
<p>All modifications to a particular atomic object <i>M</i> occur in some particular total order, called the modification order of
<i>M</i>. If <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are modifications of an atomic object <i>M</i>, and <i>A</i> happens before <i>B</i>, then
<i>A</i> shall precede <i>B</i> in the modification order of <i>M</i>, which is defined below. <basefont size="2"></p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>This states that the modification orders must respect the &quot;happens before&quot; relation.</dd>
</dl>
<basefont size="3"> <basefont size="2">
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>There is a separate order for each atomic object. There is no requirement that these can be combined into a single total order
for all objects. In general this will be impossible since different threads may observe modifications to different variables in
inconsistent orders.</dd>
</dl>
<basefont size="3">
<p>A <i>release sequence</i> headed by a release operation <i>A</i> on an atomic object <i>M</i> is a maximal contiguous
sub-sequence of side effects in the modification order of <i>M</i>, where the first operation is <i>A</i> and every subsequent
operation either is performed by the same thread that performed the release or is an atomic read-modify-write operation.</p>
<p>Certain system interfaces <i>synchronize with</i> other system interfaces performed by another thread. In particular, an atomic
operation <i>A</i> that performs a release operation on an object <i>M</i> shall synchronize with an atomic operation <i>B</i> that
performs an acquire operation on <i>M</i> and reads a value written by any side effect in the release sequence headed by <i>A</i>.
<basefont size="2"></p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>Except in the specified cases, reading a later value does not necessarily ensure visibility as described below. Such a
requirement would sometimes interfere with efficient implementation.</dd>
</dl>
<basefont size="3"> <basefont size="2">
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>The specifications of the synchronization operations define when one reads the value written by another. For atomic variables,
the definition is clear. All operations on a given mutex occur in a single total order. Each mutex acquisition &quot;reads the value
written&quot; by the last mutex release.</dd>

<p class="tent">Pathname resolution is performed for a process to resolve a pathname to a particular directory entry for a file in
the file hierarchy. There may be multiple pathnames that resolve to the same directory entry, and multiple directory entries for
the same file. When a process resolves a pathname of an existing directory entry, the entire pathname shall be resolved as
described below. When a process resolves a pathname of a directory entry that is to be created immediately after the pathname is
resolved, pathname resolution terminates when all components of the path prefix of the last component have been resolved. It is
then the responsibility of the process to create the final component.</p>
<p class="tent">Each filename in the pathname is located in the directory specified by its predecessor (for example, in the
pathname fragment <b>a/b</b>, file <b>b</b> is located in the directory specified by <b>a</b>). Pathname resolution shall fail if
this cannot be accomplished. If the pathname begins with a &lt;slash&gt;, the predecessor of the first filename in the pathname
shall be taken to be the root directory of the process (such pathnames are referred to as &quot;absolute pathnames&quot;). If the pathname
does not begin with a &lt;slash&gt;, the predecessor of the first filename of the pathname shall be taken to be either the current
working directory of the process or for certain interfaces the directory identified by a file descriptor passed to the interface
(such pathnames are referred to as &quot;relative pathnames&quot;).</p>
<p class="tent">The interpretation of a pathname component is dependent on the value of {NAME_MAX} and _POSIX_NO_TRUNC associated
with the path prefix of that component. If any pathname component is longer than {NAME_MAX}, the implementation shall consider this
an error.</p>
<p class="tent">A pathname that contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and that ends with one or more trailing
&lt;slash&gt; characters shall not be resolved successfully unless the last pathname component before the trailing &lt;slash&gt;
characters resolves (with symbolic links followed—see below) to an existing directory or a directory entry that is to be created
for a directory immediately after the pathname is resolved. Interfaces using pathname resolution may specify additional
constraints<a href="#tag_foot_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> when a pathname that does not name an existing directory contains
at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and contains one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters.</p>
<p class="tent">If a symbolic link is encountered during pathname resolution, the behavior shall depend on whether the pathname
component is at the end of the pathname and on the function being performed. If all of the following are true, then pathname
resolution is complete:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">This is the last pathname component of the pathname.</li>
<li class="tent">The pathname has no trailing &lt;slash&gt;.</li>
<li class="tent">The function is required to act on the symbolic link itself, or certain arguments direct that the function act on
the symbolic link itself.</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">In all other cases, the system shall prefix the remaining pathname, if any, with the contents of the symbolic link,
except that if the contents of the symbolic link is the empty string, then either pathname resolution shall fail with functions
reporting an [ENOENT] error and utilities writing an equivalent diagnostic message, or the pathname of the directory containing the
symbolic link shall be used in place of the contents of the symbolic link. If the contents of the symbolic link consist solely of
&lt;slash&gt; characters, then all leading &lt;slash&gt; characters of the remaining pathname shall be omitted from the resulting
combined pathname, leaving only the leading &lt;slash&gt; characters from the symbolic link contents. In the cases where prefixing
occurs, if the combined length exceeds {PATH_MAX}, and the implementation considers this to be an error, pathname resolution shall
fail with functions reporting an [ENAMETOOLONG] error and utilities writing an equivalent diagnostic message. Otherwise, the
resolved pathname shall be the resolution of the pathname just created. If the resulting pathname does not begin with a
&lt;slash&gt;, the predecessor of the first filename of the pathname is taken to be the directory containing the symbolic link.</p>
<p class="tent">If the system detects a loop in the pathname resolution process, pathname resolution shall fail with functions
reporting an [ELOOP] error and utilities writing an equivalent diagnostic message. The same may happen if during the resolution
process more symbolic links were followed than the implementation allows. This implementation-defined limit shall not be smaller
than {SYMLOOP_MAX}.</p>
<p class="tent">The special filename dot shall refer to the directory specified by its predecessor. The special filename dot-dot
shall refer to the parent directory of its predecessor directory. As a special case, in the root directory, dot-dot may refer to
the root directory itself.</p>
<p class="tent">A pathname consisting of a single &lt;slash&gt; shall resolve to the root directory of the process. A null pathname
shall not be successfully resolved. If a pathname begins with two successive &lt;slash&gt; characters, the first component
following the leading &lt;slash&gt; characters may be interpreted in an implementation-defined manner, although more than two
leading &lt;slash&gt; characters shall be treated as a single &lt;slash&gt; character.</p>

<p class="tent">For the mandatory semaphores (those not associated with the X/Open System Interfaces (XSI) option), a semaphore is
represented as a shareable resource that has a non-negative integer value. When the value is zero, there is a (possibly empty) set
of threads awaiting the availability of the semaphore.</p>
<p class="tent">For the semaphores associated with the X/Open System Interfaces (XSI) option, a semaphore is an integer with
minimum value 0 and an implementation-defined maximum value which shall be at least 32767. The <a href=
"../functions/semget.html"><i>semget</i>()</a> function can be called to create a set or array of semaphores. A semaphore set can
contain one or more semaphores up to an implementation-defined value.</p>

<p class="tent">An operation that is applied to a semaphore. If, prior to the operation, the value of the semaphore is zero, the
semaphore lock operation shall cause the calling thread to be blocked and added to the set of threads awaiting the semaphore;
otherwise, the value shall be decremented.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_21" id="tag_04_21"></a>4.21 Special Device Drivers</h3>
<p class="tent">Some devices require control operations, other than the operations that are common to most devices (such as
<a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/close.html"><i>close</i>()</a>), but because the device
belongs to a class that is not present in the majority of systems, standardization of a device-specific application program
interface (API) for controlling it has not been practical. The driver for such a device may respond to the <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> function to transfer data to the device or the <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> function to collect information from the device. The interpretation of the information
is defined by the implementor of the driver.</p>
<p class="tent">The term <i>special device</i> refers to hardware, or an object that appears to the application as such; access to
the driver for this hardware uses the file abstraction <i>character special file</i>. Implementations supporting the Device Control
option shall provide the means to integrate a device driver into the system. The means available to integrate drivers into the
system and the way character special files that refer to them are created are implementation defined. Character special files that

<h3><a name="tag_04_23" id="tag_04_23"></a>4.23 Treatment of Error Conditions for Mathematical Functions</h3>
<p class="tent">For all the functions in the <a href="../basedefs/math.h.html"><i>&lt;math.h&gt;</i></a> header, an application
wishing to check for error situations should set <i>errno</i> to 0 and call <i>feclearexcept</i>(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling the
function. On return, if <i>errno</i> is non-zero or <i>fetestexcept</i>(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is
non-zero, an error has occurred.</p>
<p class="tent">On implementations that support the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, whether or when functions in the <a href=
"../basedefs/math.h.html"><i>&lt;math.h&gt;</i></a> header raise an undeserved underflow floating-point exception is unspecified.
Otherwise, as implied by XSH <a href="../functions/feraiseexcept.html#"><i>feraiseexcept</i>()</a>, the <a href=
"../basedefs/math.h.html"><i>&lt;math.h&gt;</i></a> functions do not raise spurious floating-point exceptions (detectable by the
user), other than the inexact floating-point exception.</p>
<p class="tent">The error conditions defined for all functions in the <a href="../basedefs/math.h.html"><i>&lt;math.h&gt;</i></a>
header are domain, pole and range errors, described below. If a domain, pole, or range error occurs and the integer expression
(math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is zero, then <i>errno</i> shall either be set to the value corresponding to the error, as
specified below, or be left unmodified. If no such error occurs, <i>errno</i> shall be left unmodified regardless of the setting of
<i>math_errhandling</i>.</p>
<h4><a name="tag_04_23_01" id="tag_04_23_01"></a>4.23.1 Domain Error</h4>
<p class="tent">A &quot;domain error&quot; shall occur if an input argument is outside the domain over which the mathematical function is
defined. The description of each function lists any required domain errors; an implementation may define additional domain errors,
provided that such errors are consistent with the mathematical definition of the function.</p>
<p class="tent">On a domain error, the function shall return an implementation-defined value; if the integer expression
(math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, <i>errno</i> shall be set to [EDOM]; if the integer expression (math_errhandling &

<h4><a name="tag_04_23_02" id="tag_04_23_02"></a>4.23.2 Pole Error</h4>
<p class="tent">A &quot;pole error&quot; shall occur if the mathematical result of the function has an exact infinite result as the finite
input argument(s) are approached in the limit (for example, <tt>log(0.0)</tt>). The description of each function lists any required
pole errors; an implementation may define additional pole errors, provided that such errors are consistent with the mathematical
definition of the function.</p>
<p class="tent">On a pole error, the function shall return the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL according to
the return type, with the same sign as the correct value of the function; if the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO)
is non-zero, <i>errno</i> shall be set to [ERANGE]; if the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, the
&quot;divide-by-zero&quot; floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>
<h4><a name="tag_04_23_03" id="tag_04_23_03"></a>4.23.3 Range Error</h4>
<p class="tent">A &quot;range error&quot; shall occur if the finite mathematical result of the function cannot be represented in an object
of the specified type, due to extreme magnitude. The description of each function lists any required range errors; an
implementation may define additional range errors, provided that such errors are consistent with the mathematical definition of the
function and are the result of either overflow or underflow.</p>

<p class="tent">A floating result overflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is finite but so large that the
mathematical result cannot be represented without extraordinary roundoff error in an object of the specified type. If a floating
result overflows and default rounding is in effect, then the function shall return the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or
HUGE_VALL according to the return type, with the same sign as the correct value of the function; if the integer expression
(math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, <i>errno</i> shall be set to [ERANGE]; if the integer expression (math_errhandling &
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, the &quot;overflow&quot; floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p class="tent">The result underflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is so small that the mathematical result cannot
be represented, without extraordinary roundoff error, in an object of the specified type. If the result underflows, the function
shall return an implementation-defined value whose magnitude is no greater than the smallest normalized positive number in the
specified type; if the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, whether <i>errno</i> is set to [ERANGE] is
implementation-defined; if the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, whether the &quot;underflow&quot;
floating-point exception is raised is implementation-defined.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_04_24" id="tag_04_24"></a>4.24 Treatment of NaN Arguments for the Mathematical Functions</h3>
<p class="tent">For functions called with a NaN argument, no errors shall occur and a NaN shall be returned, except where stated
otherwise.</p>
<p class="tent">If a function with one or more NaN arguments returns a NaN result, the result should be the same as one of the NaN
arguments (after possible type conversion), except perhaps for the sign.</p>
<p class="tent">On implementations that support the IEC&nbsp;60559:1989 standard floating point, functions with signaling NaN
argument(s) shall be treated as if the function were called with an argument that is a required domain error and shall return a
quiet NaN result, except where stated otherwise. <basefont size="2"></p>
<dl>

computer source code, or a file of shell source code, directly interpreted by the shell. The program may have been produced by the
user, provided by the system implementor, or acquired from an independent distributor.</p>
<p class="tent">The system may implement certain utilities as shell functions (see XCU <a href=
