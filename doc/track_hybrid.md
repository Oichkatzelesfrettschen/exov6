# Hybrid Track

The hybrid track collects notes where technical details and high level ideas intersect. It builds on both the [technical](track_technical.md) and [philosophy](track_philosophy.md) documents, with the charter serving as the common reference point.

Examples include discussions about how a specific capability mechanism advances the broader goal of user level innovation, or how scheduler experiments influence the libOS design. When updates span philosophy and implementation, record them here.
