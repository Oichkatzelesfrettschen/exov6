<h4><a name="tag_22_01_02" id="tag_22_01_02"></a>B.1.2 Relationship to Other Formal Standards</h4>
<p class="tent">There is no additional rationale provided for this section.</p>
<h4><a name="tag_22_01_03" id="tag_22_01_03"></a>B.1.3 Format of Entries</h4>
<p class="tent">Each system interface reference page has a common layout of sections describing the interface. This layout is
similar to the manual page or &quot;man&quot; page format shipped with most UNIX systems, and each header has sections describing the
SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, RETURN VALUE, and ERRORS. These are the four sections that relate to conformance.</p>
<p class="tent">Additional sections are informative, and add considerable information for the application developer. EXAMPLES
sections provide example usage. APPLICATION USAGE sections provide additional caveats, issues, and recommendations to the
developer. RATIONALE sections give additional information on the decisions made in defining the interface.</p>
<p class="tent">FUTURE DIRECTIONS sections act as pointers to related work that may impact the interface in the future, and often
cautions the developer to architect the code to account for a change in this area. Note that a future directions statement should
not be taken as a commitment to adopt a feature or interface in the future.</p>
<p class="tent">The CHANGE HISTORY section describes when the interface was introduced, and how it has changed.</p>
<p class="tent">Option labels and margin markings in the page can be useful in guiding the application developer.</p>
<h3><a name="tag_22_02" id="tag_22_02"></a>B.2 General Information</h3>
<h4><a name="tag_22_02_01" id="tag_22_02_01"></a>B.2.1 Use and Implementation of Interfaces</h4>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_01_01" id="tag_22_02_01_01"></a>B.2.1.1 Use and Implementation of Functions</h5>
<p class="tent">The information concerning the use of functions was adapted from a description in the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Here is
an example of how an application program can protect itself from functions that may or may not be macros, rather than true
functions:</p>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/atoi.html"><i>atoi</i>()</a> function may be used in any of several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">By use of its associated header (possibly generating a macro expansion):
<pre>
<tt>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
/* ... */
i = atoi(str);
</tt></pre></li>
<li class="tent">By use of its associated header (assuredly generating a true function call):
<pre>
<tt>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#undef atoi
/* ... */
i = atoi(str);
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">or:</p>
<pre>
<tt>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
/* ... */
i = (atoi) (str);
</tt></pre></li>
<li class="tent">By explicit declaration:
<pre>
<tt>extern int atoi (const char *);
/* ... */
i = atoi(str);
</tt></pre></li>
<li class="tent">By implicit declaration:
<pre>
<tt>/* ... */
i = atoi(str);
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">(Assuming no function prototype is in scope. This is not allowed by the ISO&nbsp;C standard for functions with
variable arguments; furthermore, parameter type conversion &quot;widening&quot; is subject to different rules in this case.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">Note that the ISO&nbsp;C standard reserves names starting with <tt>'_'</tt> for the compiler. Therefore, the
compiler could, for example, implement an intrinsic, built-in function <i>_asm_builtin_atoi</i>(), which it recognized and expanded
into inline assembly code. Then, in <a href="../basedefs/stdlib.h.html"><i>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</i></a>, there could be the
following:</p>
<pre>
<tt>#define atoi(X) _asm_builtin_atoi(X)
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">The user's &quot;normal&quot; call to <a href="../functions/atoi.html"><i>atoi</i>()</a> would then be expanded inline, but
the implementor would also be required to provide a callable function named <a href="../functions/atoi.html"><i>atoi</i>()</a> for
use when the application requires it; for example, if its address is to be stored in a function pointer variable.</p>
<p class="tent">Implementors should note that since applications can <b>#undef</b> a macro in order to ensure that the function is
used, this means that it is not safe for implementations to use the names of any standard functions in macro values, since the
application could use <b>#undef</b> to ensure that no macro exists and then use the same name for an identifier with local scope.
For example, historically it was common for a <a href="../functions/getchar.html"><i>getchar</i>()</a> macro to be defined in
<a href="../basedefs/stdio.h.html"><i>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</i></a> as:</p>
<pre>
<tt>#define getchar() getc(stdin)
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">This definition does not conform, because an application is allowed to use the identifier <i>getc</i> with local
scope, and the expansion of the <a href="../functions/getchar.html"><i>getchar</i>()</a> macro would then pick up the local
<i>getc</i>. The following is conforming code, but would not compile with the above definition of <a href=
"../functions/getchar.html"><i>getchar</i>()</a>:</p>
<pre>
<tt>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#undef getc
<br class="tent">
int main(void)
{
    int getc;
<br class="tent">
    getc = getchar();
<br class="tent">
    return getc;

<p class="tent">This does not only affect function-like macros. For example, the following definition does not conform because

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_02_01" id="tag_22_02_02_01"></a>B.2.2.1 POSIX.1 Symbols</h5>
<p class="tent">This and the following section address the issue of &quot;name space pollution&quot;. The ISO&nbsp;C standard requires that
the name space beyond what it reserves not be altered except by explicit action of the application developer. This section defines
the actions to add the POSIX.1 symbols for those headers where both the ISO&nbsp;C standard and POSIX.1 need to define symbols, and
also where the XSI option extends the base standard.</p>
<p class="tent">When headers are used to provide symbols, there is a potential for introducing symbols that the application
developer cannot predict. Ideally, each header should only contain one set of symbols, but this is not practical for historical
reasons. Thus, the concept of feature test macros is included. Two feature test macros are explicitly defined by POSIX.1-2024; it
is expected that future versions may add to this. <basefont size="2"></p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>Feature test macros allow an application to announce to the implementation its desire to have certain symbols and prototypes
exposed. They should not be confused with the version test macros and constants for options in <a href=
"../basedefs/unistd.h.html"><i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i></a> which are the implementation's way of announcing functionality to the
application.</dd>
</dl>
<basefont size="3">
<p class="tent">It is further intended that these feature test macros apply only to the headers specified by POSIX.1-2024.
Implementations are expressly permitted to make visible symbols not specified by POSIX.1-2024, within both POSIX.1 and other
headers, under the control of feature test macros that are not defined by POSIX.1-2024.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_02_02" id="tag_22_02_02_02"></a>The _POSIX_C_SOURCE Feature Test Macro</h5>
<p class="tent">The POSIX.1-1990 standard specified a macro called _POSIX_SOURCE. This has been superseded by _POSIX_C_SOURCE. This
symbol will allow implementations to support various versions of this standard simultaneously. For instance, when _POSIX_C_SOURCE
is defined as 202405L, the system should make visible the same name space as permitted and required by the POSIX.1-2024 standard. A
special case is the one where the implementation wishes to make available support for the 1990 version of the POSIX standard, in
which instance when either _POSIX_SOURCE is defined or _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined as 1, the system should make visible the same
name space as permitted and required by the POSIX.1-1990 standard.</p>
<p class="tent">It is expected that C bindings to future POSIX standards will define new values for _POSIX_C_SOURCE, with each new
value reserving the name space for that new standard.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_02_03" id="tag_22_02_02_03"></a>The _XOPEN_SOURCE Feature Test Macro</h5>
<p class="tent">The feature test macro _XOPEN_SOURCE is provided as the announcement mechanism for the application that it requires
functionality from the Single UNIX Specification. _XOPEN_SOURCE must be defined to the value 800 before the inclusion of any header
to enable the functionality in the Single UNIX Specification Version 5. Its definition subsumes the use of _POSIX_C_SOURCE.</p>
<p class="tent">An extract of code from a conforming application, that appears before any <b>#include</b> statements, is given
below:</p>
<pre>
<tt>#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 800 /* Single UNIX Specification, Version 5 */
<br class="tent">
#include ...
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">Note that the definition of _XOPEN_SOURCE with the value 800 makes the definition of _POSIX_C_SOURCE redundant and
it can safely be omitted.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_02_04" id="tag_22_02_02_04"></a>The __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ Feature Test Macro</h5>
<p class="tent">The ISO&nbsp;C standard specifies the feature test macro __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ as the announcement mechanism for
the application that it requires functionality from Annex K. It specifies that the symbols specified in Annex K (if supported) are
made visible when __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ is 1 and are not made visible when it is 0, but leaves it unspecified whether they are
made visible when __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ is undefined. POSIX.1 requires that they are not made visible when the macro is undefined
(except for those symbols that are already explicitly allowed to be visible through the definition of _POSIX_C_SOURCE or
_XOPEN_SOURCE, or both).</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1 does not include the interfaces specified in Annex K of the ISO&nbsp;C standard, but allows the symbols to
be made visible in headers when requested by the application in order that applications can use symbols from Annex K and symbols
from POSIX.1 in the same translation unit.</p>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_02_05" id="tag_22_02_02_05"></a>B.2.2.2 The Name Space</h5>
<p class="tent">The reservation of identifiers is paraphrased from the ISO&nbsp;C standard. The text is included because it needs
to be part of POSIX.1-2024, regardless of possible changes in future versions of the ISO&nbsp;C standard.</p>
<p class="tent">These identifiers may be used by implementations, particularly for feature test macros. Implementations should not
use feature test macro names that might be reasonably used by a standard.</p>
<p class="tent">Including headers more than once is a reasonably common practice, and it should be carried forward from the
ISO&nbsp;C standard. More significantly, having definitions in more than one header is explicitly permitted. Where the potential
declaration is &quot;benign&quot; (the same definition twice) the declaration can be repeated, if that is permitted by the compiler. (This
is usually true of macros, for example.) In those situations where a repetition is not benign (for example, <b>typedef</b>s),
conditional compilation must be used. The situation actually occurs both within the ISO&nbsp;C standard and within POSIX.1:
<b>time_t</b> should be in <a href="../basedefs/sys_types.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i></a>, and the ISO&nbsp;C standard
mandates that it be in <a href="../basedefs/time.h.html"><i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i></a>.</p>
<p class="tent">The area of name space pollution <i>versus</i> additions to structures is difficult because of the macro structure
of C. The following discussion summarizes all the various problems with and objections to the issue.</p>
<p class="tent">Note the phrase &quot;user-defined macro&quot;. Users are not permitted to define macro names (or any other name) beginning
with <tt>"_[A-Z_]"</tt>. Thus, the conflict cannot occur for symbols reserved to the vendor's name space, and the permission to add
fields automatically applies, without qualification, to those symbols.</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">Data structures (and unions) need to be defined in headers by implementations to meet certain requirements of
POSIX.1 and the ISO&nbsp;C standard.</li>
<li class="tent">The structures defined by POSIX.1 are typically minimal, and any practical implementation would wish to add fields
to these structures either to hold additional related information or for backwards-compatibility (or both). Future standards (and
<i>de facto</i> standards) would also wish to add to these structures. Issues of field alignment make it impractical (at least in
the general case) to simply omit fields when they are not defined by the particular standard involved.
<p class="tent">The <b>dirent</b> structure is an example of such a minimal structure (although one could argue about whether the
other fields need visible names). The <i>st_rdev</i> field of most implementations' <b>stat</b> structure is a common example where
extension is needed and where a conflict could occur.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Fields in structures are in an independent name space, so the addition of such fields presents no problem to the C
language itself in that such names cannot interact with identically named user symbols because access is qualified by the specific
structure name.</li>
<li class="tent">There is an exception to this: macro processing is done at a lexical level. Thus, symbols added to a structure
might be recognized as user-provided macro names at the location where the structure is declared. This only can occur if the
user-provided name is declared as a macro before the header declaring the structure is included. The user's use of the name after
the declaration cannot interfere with the structure because the symbol is hidden and only accessible through access to the
structure. Presumably, the user would not declare such a macro if there was an intention to use that field name.</li>
<li class="tent">Macros from the same or a related header might use the additional fields in the structure, and those field names
might also collide with user macros. Although this is a less frequent occurrence, since macros are expanded at the point of use, no
constraint on the order of use of names can apply.</li>
<li class="tent">An &quot;obvious&quot; solution of using names in the reserved name space and then redefining them as macros when they
should be visible does not work because this has the effect of exporting the symbol into the general name space. For example, given
a (hypothetical) system-provided header <i>&lt;h.h&gt;</i>, and two parts of a C program in <b>a.c</b> and <b>b.c</b>, in header
<i>&lt;h.h&gt;</i>:
<pre>
<tt>struct foo {
    int __i;
}
<br class="tent">
#ifdef _FEATURE_TEST
#define i __i;
#endif
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">In file <b>a.c</b>:</p>
<pre>
<tt>#include h.h
extern int i;
...
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">In file <b>b.c</b>:</p>
<pre>
<tt>extern int i;
...
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">The symbol that the user thinks of as <i>i</i> in both files has an external name of <i>__i</i> in <b>a.c</b>; the
same symbol <i>i</i> in <b>b.c</b> has an external name <i>i</i> (ignoring any hidden manipulations the compiler might perform on
the names). This would cause a mysterious name resolution problem when <b>a.o</b> and <b>b.o</b> are linked.</p>
<p class="tent">Simply avoiding definition then causes alignment problems in the structure.</p>
<p class="tent">A structure of the form:</p>
<pre>
<tt>struct foo {
    union {
        int __i;
#ifdef _FEATURE_TEST
        int i;
#endif
    } __ii;
}
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">does not work because the name of the logical field <i>i</i> is <i>__ii.i</i>, and introduction of a macro to
restore the logical name immediately reintroduces the problem discussed previously (although its manifestation might be more
immediate because a syntax error would result if a recursive macro did not cause it to fail first).<br></p>
</li>
<li class="tent">A more workable solution would be to declare the structure:
<pre>
<tt>struct foo {
#ifdef _FEATURE_TEST
    int i;
#else
    int __i;
#endif
}
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">However, if a macro (particularly one required by a standard) is to be defined that uses this field, two must be
defined: one that uses <i>i</i>, the other that uses <i>__i</i>. If more than one additional field is used in a macro and they are
conditional on distinct combinations of features, the complexity goes up as 2<small><sup><i>n</i></sup></small>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">All this leaves a difficult situation: vendors must provide very complex headers to deal with what is conceptually
simple and safeâadding a field to a structure. It is the possibility of user-provided macros with the same name that makes this
difficult.</p>
<p class="tent">Several alternatives were proposed that involved constraining the user's access to part of the name space available
to the user (as specified by the ISO&nbsp;C standard). In some cases, this was only until all the headers had been included. There
were two proposals discussed that failed to achieve consensus:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">Limiting it for the whole program.</li>
<li class="tent">Restricting the use of identifiers containing only uppercase letters until after all system headers had been
included. It was also pointed out that because macros might wish to access fields of a structure (and macro expansion occurs
totally at point of use) restricting names in this way would not protect the macro expansion, and thus the solution was
inadequate.</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">It was finally decided that reservation of symbols would occur, but as constrained.</p>
<p class="tent">The current wording also allows the addition of fields to a structure, but requires that user macros of the same
name not interfere. This allows vendors to do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Not create the situation (do not extend the structures with user-accessible names or use the solution in (7)
above)</li>
<li class="tent">Extend their compilers to allow some way of adding names to structures and macros safely</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">There are at least two ways that the compiler might be extended: add new preprocessor directives that turn off and
on macro expansion for certain symbols (without changing the value of the macro) and a function or lexical operation that
suppresses expansion of a word. The latter seems more flexible, particularly because it addresses the problem in macros as well as
in declarations.</p>
<p class="tent">The following seems to be a possible implementation extension to the C language that will do this: any token that
during macro expansion is found to be preceded by three <tt>'#'</tt> symbols shall not be further expanded in exactly the same way
as described for macros that expand to their own name as in Section 6.10.3.4 of the ISO&nbsp;C standard. A vendor may also wish to
implement this as an operation that is lexically a function, which might be implemented as:</p>
<pre>
<tt>#define __safe_name(x) ###x
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">Using a function notation would insulate vendors from changes in standards until such a functionality is
standardized (if ever). Standardization of such a function would be valuable because it would then permit third parties to take
advantage of it portably in software they may supply.</p>
<p class="tent">The symbols that are &quot;explicitly permitted, but not required by POSIX.1-2024&quot; include those classified below.
(That is, the symbols classified below might, but are not required to, be present when _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined to have the value
202405L.)</p>

</ul>
<p class="tent">Since both implementations and future versions of this standard and other POSIX standards may use symbols in the
reserved spaces described in these tables, there is a potential for name space clashes. To avoid future name space clashes when

<h4><a name="tag_22_02_03" id="tag_22_02_03"></a>B.2.3 Error Numbers</h4>
<p class="tent">It was the consensus of the standard developers that to allow the conformance document to state that an error
occurs and under what conditions, but to disallow a statement that it never occurs, does not make sense. It could be implied by the
current wording that this is allowed, but to reduce the possibility of future interpretation requests, it is better to make an
explicit statement.</p>
<p class="tent">The original ISO&nbsp;C standard just required that <i>errno</i> be a modifiable lvalue. Since the introduction of
threads in 2011, the ISO&nbsp;C standard has instead required that <i>errno</i> be a macro which expands to a modifiable lvalue
that has thread local storage duration.</p>
<p class="tent">Checking the value of <i>errno</i> alone is not sufficient to determine the existence or type of an error, since it
is not required that a successful function call clear <i>errno</i>. The variable <i>errno</i> should only be examined when the
return value of a function indicates that the value of <i>errno</i> is meaningful. In that case, the function is required to set
the variable to something other than zero.</p>
<p class="tent">The variable <i>errno</i> is never set to zero by any function call; to do so would contradict the ISO&nbsp;C
standard.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1 requires (in the ERRORS sections of function descriptions) certain error values to be set in certain
conditions because many existing applications depend on them. Some error numbers, such as [EFAULT], are entirely
implementation-defined and are noted as such in their description in the ERRORS section. This section otherwise allows wide
latitude to the implementation in handling error reporting.</p>
<p class="tent">Some of the ERRORS sections in POSIX.1-2024 have two subsections. The first:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
&quot;The function shall fail if:&quot;
</pre></blockquote>
<p class="tent">could be called the &quot;mandatory&quot; section.</p>
<p class="tent">The second:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
&quot;The function may fail if:&quot;
</pre></blockquote>
<p class="tent">could be informally known as the &quot;optional&quot; section.</p>
<p class="tent">Attempting to infer the quality of an implementation based on whether it detects optional error conditions is not
useful.</p>
<p class="tent">Following each one-word symbolic name for an error, there is a description of the error. The rationale for some of
the symbolic names follows:</p>
<dl compact>
<dd></dd>
<dt>[ECANCELED]</dt>
<dd>This spelling was chosen as being more common.</dd>
<dt>[EFAULT]</dt>
<dd>Most historical implementations do not catch an error and set <i>errno</i> when an invalid address is given to the functions
<a href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/time.html"><i>time</i>()</a>, or <a href=
"../functions/times.html"><i>times</i>()</a>. Some implementations cannot reliably detect an invalid address. And most systems that
detect invalid addresses will do so only for a system call, not for a library routine.</dd>
<dt>[EFTYPE]</dt>
<dd>This error code was proposed in earlier proposals as &quot;Inappropriate operation for file type&quot;, meaning that the operation
requested is not appropriate for the file specified in the function call. This code was proposed, although the same idea was
covered by [ENOTTY], because the connotations of the name would be misleading. It was pointed out that the <a href=
"../functions/fcntl.html"><i>fcntl</i>()</a> function uses the error code [EINVAL] for this notion, and hence all instances of
[EFTYPE] were changed to this code.</dd>
<dt>[EINTR]</dt>
<dd>POSIX.1 prohibits conforming implementations from restarting interrupted system calls of conforming applications unless the
SA_RESTART flag is in effect for the signal. However, it does not require that [EINTR] be returned when another legitimate value
may be substituted; for example, a partial transfer count when <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> are interrupted. This is only given when the signal-catching function returns normally
as opposed to returns by mechanisms like <a href="../functions/longjmp.html"><i>longjmp</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/siglongjmp.html"><i>siglongjmp</i>()</a>.</dd>
<dt>[ELOOP]</dt>
<dd>In specifying conditions under which implementations would generate this error, the following goals were considered:
<ul>
<li class="tent">To ensure that actual loops are detected, including loops that result from symbolic links across distributed file
systems.</li>
<li class="tent">To ensure that during pathname resolution an application can rely on the ability to follow at least {SYMLOOP_MAX}
symbolic links in the absence of a loop.</li>
<li class="tent">To allow implementations to provide the capability of traversing more than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links in the
absence of a loop.</li>
<li class="tent">To allow implementations to detect loops and generate the error prior to encountering {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic
links.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]</dt>
<dd><br>
When a symbolic link is encountered during pathname resolution, the contents of that symbolic link are used to create a new
pathname. The standard developers intended to allow, but not require, that implementations enforce the restriction of {PATH_MAX} on
the result of this pathname substitution.
<p class="tent">Implementations are allowed, but not required, to treat a pathname longer than {PATH_MAX} passed into the system as
an error. Implementations are required to return a pathname (even if it is longer than {PATH_MAX}) when the user supplies a buffer
with an interface that specifies the buffer size, as long as the user-supplied buffer is large enough to hold the entire pathname
(see XSH <a href="../functions/getcwd.html#"><i>getcwd</i>()</a> for an example of this type of interface). Implementations are
required to treat a request to pass a pathname longer than {PATH_MAX} from the system to a user-supplied buffer of an unspecified
size (usually assumed to be of size {PATH_MAX}) as an error (see XSH <a href="../functions/realpath.html#"><i>realpath</i>()</a>
for an example of this type of interface).</p>
</dd>
<dt>[ENOMEM]</dt>
<dd>The term &quot;main memory&quot; is not used in POSIX.1 because it is implementation-defined.</dd>
<dt>[ENOTSUP]</dt>
<dd>This error code is to be used when an implementation chooses to implement the required functionality of POSIX.1-2024 but does
not support optional facilities defined by POSIX.1-2024. In some earlier versions of this standard, the difference between
[ENOTSUP] and [ENOSYS] was that [ENOSYS] indicated that the function was not supported at all. This is no longer the case as
[ENOSYS] can also be used to indicate non-support of optional functionality for a function that has some required functionality.
(See XSH <a href="../functions/encrypt.html#"><i>encrypt</i>()</a>.)</dd>
<dt>[ENOTTY]</dt>
<dd>The symbolic name for this error is derived from a time when device control was done by <i>ioctl</i>() and that operation was
only permitted on a terminal interface. The term &quot;TTY&quot; is derived from &quot;teletypewriter&quot;, the devices to which this error
originally applied.</dd>
<dt>[EOVERFLOW]</dt>
<dd>Most of the uses of this error code are related to large file support. Typically, these cases occur on systems which support
multiple programming environments with different sizes for <b>off_t</b>, but they may also occur in connection with remote file
systems.
<p class="tent">In addition, when different programming environments have different widths for types such as <b>int</b> and

In that case, this error should be raised. For example, suppose the currently running process has 64-bit <b>int</b>, and file

the call to <a href="../functions/execl.html"><i>execl</i>()</a> can fail with <i>errno</i> set to [EOVERFLOW]. A similar failure
can occur with <a href="../functions/execl.html"><i>execl</i>()</a> if any of the user IDs or any of the group IDs to be assigned

<h5><a name="tag_22_02_03_01" id="tag_22_02_03_01"></a>Alternative Solutions for Per-Thread errno</h5>
<p class="tent">The historical implementation of <i>errno</i> as a single global variable does not work in a multi-threaded
environment. In such an environment, a thread may make a POSIX.1 call and get a -1 error return, but before that thread can check
the value of <i>errno</i>, another thread might have made a second POSIX.1 call that also set <i>errno</i>. This behavior is
unacceptable in robust programs. There were a number of alternatives that were considered for handling the <i>errno</i>
problem:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Implement <i>errno</i> as a per-thread integer variable.</li>
<li class="tent">Implement <i>errno</i> as a service that can access the per-thread error number.</li>
<li class="tent">Change all POSIX.1 calls to accept an extra status argument and avoid setting <i>errno</i>.</li>
<li class="tent">Change all POSIX.1 calls to raise a language exception.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">The first option offers the highest level of compatibility with existing practice but requires special support in
the linker, compiler, and/or virtual memory system to support the new concept of thread private variables. When compared with
current practice, the third and fourth options are much cleaner, more efficient, and encourage a more robust programming style, but
they require new versions of all of the POSIX.1 functions that might detect an error. The second option offers compatibility with
existing code that uses the <a href="../basedefs/errno.h.html"><i>&lt;errno.h&gt;</i></a> header to define the symbol <i>errno</i>.
In this option, <i>errno</i> may be a macro defined:</p>
<pre>
<tt>#define errno  (*__errno())
extern int      *__errno();
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">This option may be implemented as a per-thread variable whereby an <i>errno</i> field is allocated in the user
space object representing a thread, and whereby the function <i>__errno</i>() makes a system call to determine the location of its
user space object and returns the address of the <i>errno</i> field of that object. Another implementation, one that avoids calling
the kernel, involves allocating stacks in chunks. The stack allocator keeps a side table indexed by chunk number containing a
pointer to the thread object that uses that chunk. The <i>__errno</i>() function then looks at the stack pointer, determines the
chunk number, and uses that as an index into the chunk table to find its thread object and thus its private value of <i>errno</i>.
On most architectures, this can be done in four to five instructions. Some compilers may wish to implement <i>__errno</i>() inline
to improve performance.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_03_02" id="tag_22_02_03_02"></a>Disallowing Return of the [EINTR] Error Code</h5>
<p class="tent">Many blocking interfaces defined by POSIX.1-2024 may return [EINTR] if interrupted during their execution by a
signal handler. Blocking interfaces introduced under the threads functionality do not have this property. Instead, they require
that the interface appear to be atomic with respect to interruption. In particular, applications calling blocking interfaces need
not handle any possible [EINTR] return as a special case since it will never occur. In the case of threads functions in <a href=
"../basedefs/threads.h.html"><i>&lt;threads.h&gt;</i></a>, the requirement is stated in terms of the call not being affected if the
calling thread executes a signal handler during the call, since these functions return errors in a different way and cannot
distinguish an [EINTR] condition from other error conditions. If it is necessary to restart operations or complete incomplete
operations following the execution of a signal handler, this is handled by the implementation, rather than by the application.</p>
<p class="tent">Requiring applications to handle [EINTR] errors on blocking interfaces has been shown to be a frequent source of
often unreproducible bugs, and it adds no compelling value to the available functionality. Thus, blocking interfaces introduced for
use by multi-threaded programs do not use this paradigm. In particular, in none of the functions <a href=
"../functions/flockfile.html"><i>flockfile</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_wait.html"><i>pthread_cond_wait</i>()</a>, <a href=

"../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> did providing [EINTR] returns add value, or even particularly make sense. Thus,
these functions do not provide for an [EINTR] return, even when interrupted by a signal handler. The same arguments can be applied
to <a href="../functions/sem_wait.html"><i>sem_wait</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/sem_trywait.html"><i>sem_trywait</i>()</a>,
<a href="../functions/sigwaitinfo.html"><i>sigwaitinfo</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/sigtimedwait.html"><i>sigtimedwait</i>()</a>, but implementations are permitted to return [EINTR] error codes for
these functions for compatibility with earlier versions of this standard. Applications cannot rely on calls to these functions
returning [EINTR] error codes when signals are delivered to the calling thread, but they should allow for the possibility.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_22_02_04" id="tag_22_02_04"></a>B.2.4 Signal Concepts</h4>
<p class="tent">Historical implementations of signals, using the <a href="../functions/signal.html"><i>signal</i>()</a> function,
have shortcomings that make them unreliable for many application uses. Because of this, a new signal mechanism, based very closely
on the one of 4.2 BSD and 4.3 BSD, was added to POSIX.1.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_04_01" id="tag_22_02_04_01"></a>Signal Names</h5>
<p class="tent">The restriction on the actual type used for <b>sigset_t</b> is intended to guarantee that these objects can always
be assigned, have their address taken, and be passed as parameters by value. It is not intended that this type be a structure
including pointers to other data structures, as that could impact the portability of applications performing such operations. A
reasonable implementation could be a structure containing an array of some integer type.</p>
<p class="tent">The signals described in POSIX.1-2024 must have unique values so that they may be named as parameters of
<b>case</b> statements in the body of a C-language <b>switch</b> clause. However, implementation-defined signals may have values
that overlap with each other or with signals specified in POSIX.1-2024. An example of this is SIGABRT, which traditionally overlaps
some other signal, such as SIGIOT.</p>
<p class="tent">SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, and SIGUSR2 are ordinarily generated only through the explicit use of the <a href=
"../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a> function, although some implementations generate SIGKILL under extraordinary
circumstances. SIGTERM is traditionally the default signal sent by the <a href="../utilities/kill.html"><i>kill</i></a>
command.</p>
<p class="tent">The signals SIGBUS, SIGEMT, SIGIOT, SIGTRAP, and SIGSYS were omitted from POSIX.1 because their behavior is
implementation-defined and could not be adequately categorized. Conforming implementations may deliver these signals, but must
document the circumstances under which they are delivered and note any restrictions concerning their delivery. The signals SIGFPE,
SIGILL, and SIGSEGV are similar in that they also generally result only from programming errors. They were included in POSIX.1
because they do indicate three relatively well-categorized conditions. They are all defined by the ISO&nbsp;C standard and thus
would have to be defined by any system with an ISO&nbsp;C standard binding, even if not explicitly included in POSIX.1.</p>
<p class="tent">There is very little that a Conforming POSIX.1 Application can do by catching, ignoring, or masking any of the
signals SIGILL, SIGTRAP, SIGIOT, SIGEMT, SIGBUS, SIGSEGV, SIGSYS, or SIGFPE. They will generally be generated by the system only in
cases of programming errors. While it may be desirable for some robust code (for example, a library routine) to be able to detect
and recover from programming errors in other code, these signals are not nearly sufficient for that purpose. One portable use that
does exist for these signals is that a command interpreter can recognize them as the cause of termination of a process (with
<a href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a>) and print an appropriate message. The mnemonic tags for these signals are
derived from their PDP-11 origin.</p>
<p class="tent">The signals SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGCONT are provided for job control and are unchanged from 4.2
BSD. The signal SIGCHLD is also typically used by job control shells to detect children that have terminated or, as in 4.2 BSD,
stopped.</p>
<p class="tent">Some implementations, including System&nbsp;V, have a signal named SIGCLD, which is similar to SIGCHLD in 4.2 BSD.
POSIX.1 permits implementations to have a single signal with both names. POSIX.1 carefully specifies ways in which conforming
applications can avoid the semantic differences between the two different implementations. The name SIGCHLD was chosen for POSIX.1
because most current application usages of it can remain unchanged in conforming applications. SIGCLD in System&nbsp;V has more
cases of semantics that POSIX.1 does not specify, and thus applications using it are more likely to require changes in addition to
the name change.</p>
<p class="tent">The signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are commonly used by applications for notification of exceptional behavior and are
described as &quot;reserved as application-defined&quot; so that such use is not prohibited. Implementations should not generate SIGUSR1 or
SIGUSR2, except when explicitly requested by <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a>. It is recommended that libraries
not use these two signals, as such use in libraries could interfere with their use by applications calling the libraries. If such
use is unavoidable, it should be documented. It is prudent for non-portable libraries to use non-standard signals to avoid
conflicts with use of standard signals by portable libraries.</p>
<p class="tent">There is no portable way for an application to catch or ignore non-standard signals. Some implementations define
the range of signal numbers, so applications can install signal-catching functions for all of them. Unfortunately,
implementation-defined signals often cause problems when caught or ignored by applications that do not understand the reason for
the signal. While the desire exists for an application to be more robust by handling all possible signals (even those only
generated by <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a>), no existing mechanism was found to be sufficiently portable to
include in POSIX.1. The value of such a mechanism, if included, would be diminished given that SIGKILL would still not be
catchable.</p>
<p class="tent">A number of new signal numbers are reserved for applications because the two user signals defined by POSIX.1 are
insufficient for many realtime applications. A range of signal numbers is specified, rather than an enumeration of additional
reserved signal names, because different applications and application profiles will require a different number of application
signals. It is not desirable to burden all application domains and therefore all implementations with the maximum number of signals
required by all possible applications. Note that in this context, signal numbers are essentially different signal priorities.</p>
<p class="tent">The relatively small number of required additional signals, {_POSIX_RTSIG_MAX}, was chosen so as not to require an
unreasonably large signal mask/set. While this number of signals defined in POSIX.1 will fit in a single 32-bit word signal mask,
it is recognized that most existing implementations define many more signals than are specified in POSIX.1 and, in fact, many
implementations have already exceeded 32 signals (including the &quot;null signal&quot;). Support of {_POSIX_RTSIG_MAX} additional signals
may push some implementation over the single 32-bit word line, but is unlikely to push any implementations that are already over
that line beyond the 64-signal line.</p>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_04_02" id="tag_22_02_04_02"></a>B.2.4.1 Signal Generation and Delivery</h5>
<p class="tent">The terms defined in this section are not used consistently in documentation of historical systems. Each signal can
be considered to have a lifetime beginning with generation and ending with delivery or acceptance. The POSIX.1 definition of
&quot;delivery&quot; does not exclude ignored signals; this is considered a more consistent definition. This revised text in several parts
of POSIX.1-2024 clarifies the distinct semantics of asynchronous signal delivery and synchronous signal acceptance. The previous
wording attempted to categorize both under the term &quot;delivery&quot;, which led to conflicts over whether the effects of asynchronous
signal delivery applied to synchronous signal acceptance.</p>
<p class="tent">Signals generated for a process are delivered to only one thread. Thus, if more than one thread is eligible to
receive a signal, one has to be chosen. The choice of threads is left entirely up to the implementation both to allow the widest
possible range of conforming implementations and to give implementations the freedom to deliver the signal to the &quot;easiest
possible&quot; thread should there be differences in ease of delivery between different threads.</p>
<p class="tent">Note that should multiple delivery among cooperating threads be required by an application, this can be trivially
constructed out of the provided single-delivery semantics. The construction of a <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() function that
accomplishes this goal is presented with the rationale for <a href="../functions/sigwaitinfo.html"><i>sigwaitinfo</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">Implementations should deliver unblocked signals as soon after they are generated as possible. However, it is
difficult for POSIX.1 to make specific requirements about this, beyond those in <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a>
and <a href="../functions/sigprocmask.html"><i>sigprocmask</i>()</a>. Even on systems with prompt delivery, scheduling of higher
priority processes is always likely to cause delays.</p>
<p class="tent">In general, the interval between the generation and delivery of unblocked signals cannot be detected by an
application. Thus, references to pending signals generally apply to blocked, pending signals. An implementation registers a signal
as pending on the process when no thread has the signal unblocked and there are no threads blocked in a <a href=
"../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> function for that signal. Thereafter, the implementation delivers the signal to
the first thread that unblocks the signal or calls a <a href="../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> function on a signal
set containing this signal rather than choosing the recipient thread at the time the signal is sent.</p>
<p class="tent">In the 4.3 BSD system, signals that are blocked and set to SIG_IGN are discarded immediately upon generation. For a
signal that is ignored as its default action, if the action is SIG_DFL and the signal is blocked, a generated signal remains
pending. In the 4.1 BSD system and in System&nbsp;V Release 3 (two other implementations that support a somewhat similar signal
mechanism), all ignored blocked signals remain pending if generated. Because it is not normally useful for an application to
simultaneously ignore and block the same signal, it was unnecessary for POSIX.1 to specify behavior that would invalidate any of
the historical implementations.</p>
<p class="tent">There is one case in some historical implementations where an unblocked, pending signal does not remain pending
until it is delivered. In the System&nbsp;V implementation of <a href="../functions/signal.html"><i>signal</i>()</a>, pending
signals are discarded when the action is set to SIG_DFL or a signal-catching routine (as well as to SIG_IGN). Except in the case of
setting SIGCHLD to SIG_DFL, implementations that do this do not conform completely to POSIX.1. Some earlier proposals for POSIX.1
explicitly stated this, but these statements were redundant due to the requirement that functions defined by POSIX.1 not change
attributes of processes defined by POSIX.1 except as explicitly stated.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1 specifically states that the order in which multiple, simultaneously pending signals are delivered is
unspecified. This order has not been explicitly specified in historical implementations, but has remained quite consistent and been
known to those familiar with the implementations. Thus, there have been cases where applications (usually system utilities) have
been written with explicit or implicit dependencies on this order. Implementors and others porting existing applications may need
to be aware of such dependencies.</p>
<p class="tent">When there are multiple pending signals that are not blocked, implementations should arrange for the delivery of
all signals at once, if possible. Some implementations stack calls to all pending signal-catching routines, making it appear that
each signal-catcher was interrupted by the next signal. In this case, the implementation should ensure that this stacking of
signals does not violate the semantics of the signal masks established by <a href=
"../functions/sigaction.html"><i>sigaction</i>()</a>. Other implementations process at most one signal when the operating system is
entered, with remaining signals saved for later delivery. Although this practice is widespread, this behavior is neither
standardized nor endorsed. In either case, implementations should attempt to deliver signals associated with the current state of
the process (for example, SIGFPE) before other signals, if possible.</p>
<p class="tent">In 4.2 BSD and 4.3 BSD, it is not permissible to ignore or explicitly block SIGCONT, because if blocking or
ignoring this signal prevented it from continuing a stopped process, such a process could never be continued (only killed by
SIGKILL). However, 4.2 BSD and 4.3 BSD do block SIGCONT during execution of its signal-catching function when it is caught,
creating exactly this problem. A proposal was considered to disallow catching SIGCONT in addition to ignoring and blocking it, but
this limitation led to objections. The consensus was to require that SIGCONT always continue a stopped process when generated. This
removed the need to disallow ignoring or explicit blocking of the signal; note that SIG_IGN and SIG_DFL are equivalent for
SIGCONT.</p>

<p class="tent">The realtime signals functionality is required in this version of the standard for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">The <b>sigevent</b> structure is used by other POSIX.1 functions that result in asynchronous event notifications
to specify the notification mechanism to use and other information needed by the notification mechanism. POSIX.1-2024 defines only
three symbolic values for the notification mechanism:
<ul>
<li class="tent">SIGEV_NONE is used to indicate that no notification is required when the event occurs. This is useful for
applications that use asynchronous I/O with polling for completion.</li>
<li class="tent">SIGEV_SIGNAL indicates that a signal is generated when the event occurs.</li>
<li class="tent">SIGEV_THREAD provides for &quot;callback functions&quot; for asynchronous notifications done by a function call within the
context of a new thread. This provides a multi-threaded process with a more natural means of notification than signals.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">The primary difficulty with previous notification approaches has been to specify the environment of the
notification routine.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">One approach is to limit the notification routine to call only functions permitted in a signal handler. While the
list of permissible functions is clearly stated, this is overly restrictive.</li>
<li class="tent">A second approach is to define a new list of functions or classes of functions that are explicitly permitted or
not permitted. This would give a programmer more lists to deal with, which would be awkward.</li>
<li class="tent">The third approach is to define completely the environment for execution of the notification function. A clear
definition of an execution environment for notification is provided by executing the notification function in the environment of a
newly created thread.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">Implementations may support additional notification mechanisms by defining new values for <i>sigev_notify</i>.</p>
<p class="tent">For a notification type of SIGEV_SIGNAL, the other members of the <b>sigevent</b> structure defined by POSIX.1-2024
specify the realtime signalâthat is, the signal number and application-defined value that differentiates between occurrences of
signals with the same numberâthat will be generated when the event occurs. The structure is defined in <a href=
"../basedefs/signal.h.html"><i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i></a>, even though the structure is not directly used by any of the signal
functions, because it is part of the signals interface used by the POSIX.1b &quot;client functions&quot;. When the client functions include
<a href="../basedefs/signal.h.html"><i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i></a> to define the signal names, the <b>sigevent</b> structure will also
be defined.</p>
<p class="tent">An application-defined value passed to the signal handler is used to differentiate between different &quot;events&quot;
instead of requiring that the application use different signal numbers for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Realtime applications potentially handle a very large number of different events. Requiring that implementations
support a correspondingly large number of distinct signal numbers will adversely impact the performance of signal delivery because
the signal masks to be manipulated on entry and exit to the handlers will become large.</li>
<li class="tent">Event notifications are prioritized by signal number (the rationale for this is explained in the following
paragraphs) and the use of different signal numbers to differentiate between the different event notifications overloads the signal
number more than has already been done. It also requires that the application developer make arbitrary assignments of priority to
events that are logically of equal priority.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">A union is defined for the application-defined value so that either an integer constant or a pointer can be
portably passed to the signal-catching function. On some architectures a pointer cannot be cast to an <b>int</b> and <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>
<p class="tent">Use of a structure here with an explicit notification type discriminant rather than explicit parameters to realtime
functions, or embedded in other realtime structures, provides for future extensions to POSIX.1-2024. Additional, perhaps more
efficient, notification mechanisms can be supported for existing realtime function interfaces, such as timers and asynchronous I/O,
by extending the <b>sigevent</b> structure appropriately. The existing realtime function interfaces will not have to be modified to
use any such new notification mechanism. The revised text concerning the SIGEV_SIGNAL value makes consistent the semantics of the
members of the <b>sigevent</b> structure, particularly in the definitions of <a href=
"../functions/lio_listio.html"><i>lio_listio</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/aio_fsync.html"><i>aio_fsync</i>()</a>. For
uniformity, other revisions cause this specification to be referred to rather than inaccurately duplicated in the descriptions of
functions and structures using the <b>sigevent</b> structure. The revised wording does not relax the requirement that the signal
number be in the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX to guarantee queuing and passing of the application value, since that requirement is
still implied by the signal names.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">POSIX.1-2024 is intentionally vague on whether &quot;non-realtime&quot; signal-generating mechanisms can result in a
<b>siginfo_t</b> being supplied to the handler on delivery. In one existing implementation, a <b>siginfo_t</b> is posted on signal
generation, even though the implementation does not support queuing of multiple occurrences of a signal. It is not the intent of
POSIX.1-2024 to preclude this, independent of the mandate to define signals that do support queuing. Any interpretation that
appears to preclude this is a mistake in the reading or writing of the standard.</li>
<li class="tent">Signals handled by realtime signal handlers might be generated by functions or conditions that do not allow the
specification of an application-defined value and do not queue. POSIX.1-2024 specifies the <i>si_code</i> member of the
<b>siginfo_t</b> structure used in existing practice and defines additional codes so that applications can detect whether an
application-defined value is present or not. The code SI_USER for <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a>- generated
signals is adopted from existing practice.</li>
<li class="tent">The <a href="../functions/sigaction.html"><i>sigaction</i>()</a> <i>sa_flags</i> value SA_SIGINFO tells the
implementation that the signal-catching function expects two additional arguments. When the flag is not set, a single argument, the
signal number, is passed as specified by POSIX.1-2024. Although POSIX.1-2024 does not explicitly allow the <i>info</i> argument to
the handler function to be NULL, this is existing practice. This provides for compatibility with programs whose signal-catching
functions are not prepared to accept the additional arguments. POSIX.1-2024 is explicitly unspecified as to whether signals
actually queue when SA_SIGINFO is not set for a signal, as there appear to be no benefits to applications in specifying one
behavior or another. One existing implementation queues a <b>siginfo_t</b> on each signal generation, unless the signal is already
pending, in which case the implementation discards the new <b>siginfo_t</b>; that is, the queue length is never greater than one.
This implementation only examines SA_SIGINFO on signal delivery, discarding the queued <b>siginfo_t</b> if its delivery was not
requested.
<p class="tent">The third argument to the signal-catching function, <i>context</i>, is left undefined by POSIX.1-2024, but is
specified in the interface because it matches existing practice for the SA_SIGINFO flag. It was considered undesirable to require a
separate implementation for SA_SIGINFO for POSIX conformance on implementations that already support the two additional
parameters.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">The requirement to deliver lower numbered signals in the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX first, when multiple unblocked
signals are pending, results from several considerations:
<ul>
<li class="tent">A method is required to prioritize event notifications. The signal number was chosen instead of, for instance,
associating a separate priority with each request, because an implementation has to check pending signals at various points and
select one for delivery when more than one is pending. Specifying a selection order is the minimal additional semantic that will
achieve prioritized delivery. If a separate priority were to be associated with queued signals, it would be necessary for an
implementation to search all non-empty, non-blocked signal queues and select from among them the pending signal with the highest
priority. This would significantly increase the cost of and decrease the determinism of signal delivery.</li>
<li class="tent">Given the specified selection of the lowest numeric unblocked pending signal, preemptive priority signal delivery
can be achieved using signal numbers and signal masks by ensuring that the <i>sa_mask</i> for each signal number blocks all signals
with a higher numeric value.
<p class="tent">For realtime applications that want to use only the newly defined realtime signal numbers without interference from
the standard signals, this can be achieved by blocking all of the standard signals in the thread signal mask and in the
<i>sa_mask</i> installed by the signal action for the realtime signal handlers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1-2024 explicitly leaves unspecified the ordering of signals outside of the range of realtime signals and the
ordering of signals within this range with respect to those outside the range. It was believed that this would unduly constrain
implementations or standards in the future definition of new signals.</p>

<p class="tent">Early proposals mentioned SIGCONT as a second exception to the rule that signals are not delivered to stopped
processes until continued. Because POSIX.1-2024 now specifies that SIGCONT causes the stopped process to continue when it is
generated, delivery of SIGCONT is not prevented because a process is stopped, even without an explicit exception to this rule.</p>
<p class="tent">Ignoring a signal by setting the action to SIG_IGN (or SIG_DFL for signals whose default action is to ignore) is
not the same as installing a signal-catching function that simply returns. Invoking such a function will interrupt certain system
functions that block processes (for example, <a href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/sigsuspend.html"><i>sigsuspend</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/pause.html"><i>pause</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>) while ignoring a signal has no
such effect on the process.</p>
<p class="tent">Historical implementations discard pending signals when the action is set to SIG_IGN. However, they do not always
do the same when the action is set to SIG_DFL and the default action is to ignore the signal. POSIX.1-2024 requires this for the
sake of consistency and also for completeness, since the only signal this applies to is SIGCHLD, and POSIX.1-2024 disallows setting
its action to SIG_IGN.</p>
<p class="tent">Some implementations (System&nbsp;V, for example) assign different semantics for SIGCLD depending on whether the
action is set to SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL. Since POSIX.1 requires that the default action for SIGCHLD be to ignore the signal,
applications should always set the action to SIG_DFL in order to avoid SIGCHLD.</p>
<p class="tent">Whether or not an implementation allows SIG_IGN as a SIGCHLD disposition to be inherited across a call to one of
the <i>exec</i> family of functions or <a href="../functions/posix_spawn.html"><i>posix_spawn</i>()</a> is explicitly left as
unspecified. This change was made as a result of IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.1 #132, and permits the implementation to decide
between the following alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Unconditionally leave SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN, in which case the implementation would not allow applications that
assume inheritance of SIG_DFL to conform to POSIX.1-2024 without change. The implementation would, however, retain an ability to
control applications that create child processes but never call on the <i>wait</i> family of functions, potentially filling up the
process table.</li>
<li class="tent">Unconditionally reset SIGCHLD to SIG_DFL, in which case the implementation would allow applications that assume
inheritance of SIG_DFL to conform. The implementation would, however, lose an ability to control applications that spawn child
processes but never reap them.</li>
<li class="tent">Provide some mechanism, not specified in POSIX.1-2024, to control inherited SIGCHLD dispositions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">Some implementations (System&nbsp;V, for example) will deliver a SIGCLD signal immediately when a process
establishes a signal-catching function for SIGCLD when that process has a child that has already terminated. Other implementations,
such as 4.3 BSD, do not generate a new SIGCHLD signal in this way. In general, a process should not attempt to alter the signal
action for the SIGCHLD signal while it has any outstanding children. However, it is not always possible for a process to avoid
this; for example, shells sometimes start up processes in pipelines with other processes from the pipeline as children. Processes
that cannot ensure that they have no children when altering the signal action for SIGCHLD thus need to be prepared for, but not
depend on, generation of an immediate SIGCHLD signal.</p>
<p class="tent">The default action of the stop signals (SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU) is to stop a process that is executing.
If a stop signal is delivered to a process that is already stopped, it has no effect. In fact, if a stop signal is generated for a
stopped process whose signal mask blocks the signal, the signal will never be delivered to the process since the process must
receive a SIGCONT, which discards all pending stop signals, in order to continue executing.</p>
<p class="tent">The SIGCONT signal continues a stopped process even if SIGCONT is blocked (or ignored). However, if a
signal-catching routine has been established for SIGCONT, it will not be entered until SIGCONT is unblocked.</p>
<p class="tent">If a process in an orphaned process group stops, it is no longer under the control of a job control shell and hence
would not normally ever be continued. Because of this, orphaned processes that receive terminal-related stop signals (SIGTSTP,
SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, but not SIGSTOP) must not be allowed to stop. The goal is to prevent stopped processes from languishing forever.
(As SIGSTOP is sent only via <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a>, it is assumed that the process or user sending a
SIGSTOP can send a SIGCONT when desired.) Instead, the system must discard the stop signal. As an extension, it may also deliver
another signal in its place. 4.3 BSD sends a SIGKILL, which is overly effective because SIGKILL is not catchable. Another possible
choice is SIGHUP. 4.3 BSD also does this for orphaned processes (processes whose parent has terminated) rather than for members of
orphaned process groups; this is less desirable because job control shells manage process groups. POSIX.1 also prevents SIGTTIN and
SIGTTOU signals from being generated for processes in orphaned process groups as a direct result of activity on a terminal,
preventing infinite loops when <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> calls generate signals that are discarded; see <a href=
"../xrat/V4_xbd_chap01.html#tag_21_11_01_04"><i>A.11.1.4 Terminal Access Control</i></a>. A similar restriction on the generation
of SIGTSTP was considered, but that would be unnecessary and more difficult to implement due to its asynchronous nature.</p>
<p class="tent">Although POSIX.1 requires that signal-catching functions be called with only one argument, there is nothing to
prevent conforming implementations from extending POSIX.1 to pass additional arguments, as long as Strictly Conforming POSIX.1
Applications continue to compile and execute correctly. Most historical implementations do, in fact, pass additional,
signal-specific arguments to certain signal-catching routines.</p>
<p class="tent">There was a proposal to change the declared type of the signal handler to:</p>
<pre>
<tt>void </tt><i>func</i><tt> (int </tt><i>sig</i><tt>, ...);
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">The usage of ellipses (<tt>"..."</tt>) is ISO&nbsp;C standard syntax to indicate a variable number of arguments.
Its use was intended to allow the implementation to pass additional information to the signal handler in a standard manner.</p>
<p class="tent">Unfortunately, this construct would require all signal handlers to be defined with this syntax because the
ISO&nbsp;C standard allows implementations to use a different parameter passing mechanism for variable parameter lists than for
non-variable parameter lists. Thus, all existing signal handlers in all existing applications would have to be changed to use the
variable syntax in order to be standard and portable. This is in conflict with the goal of Minimal Changes to Existing Application
Code.</p>
<p class="tent">When terminating a process from a signal-catching function, processes should be aware of any interpretation that
their parent may make of the status returned by <a href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/waitid.html"><i>waitid</i>()</a>, or <a href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a>. In particular, a
signal-catching function should not call <i>exit</i>(0) or <i>_exit</i>(0) unless it wants to indicate successful termination. A
non-zero argument to <a href="../functions/exit.html"><i>exit</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/_exit.html"><i>_exit</i>()</a> can
be used to indicate unsuccessful termination. Alternatively, the process can use <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a>
to send itself a fatal signal (first ensuring that the signal is set to the default action and not blocked). See also the RATIONALE
section of the <a href="../functions/_exit.html"><i>_exit</i>()</a> function.</p>
<p class="tent">The behavior of <i>unsafe</i> functions, as defined by this section, is undefined when they are called from (or
after a <a href="../functions/longjmp.html"><i>longjmp</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/siglongjmp.html"><i>siglongjmp</i>()</a>
out of) signal-catching functions in certain circumstances. The behavior of async-signal-safe functions, as defined by this
section, is as specified by POSIX.1, regardless of invocation from a signal-catching function. This is the only intended meaning of
the statement that async-signal-safe functions may be used in signal-catching functions without restriction. Applications must
still consider all effects of such functions on such things as data structures, files, and process state. In particular,
application developers need to consider the restrictions on interactions when interrupting <a href=
"../functions/sleep.html"><i>sleep</i>()</a> (see <a href="../functions/sleep.html"><i>sleep</i>()</a>) and interactions among
multiple handles for a file description. The fact that any specific function is listed as async-signal-safe does not necessarily
mean that invocation of that function from a signal-catching function is recommended.</p>
<p class="tent">In order to prevent errors arising from interrupting non-async-signal-safe function calls, applications should
protect calls to these functions either by blocking the appropriate signals or through the use of some programmatic semaphore.
POSIX.1 does not address the more general problem of synchronizing access to shared data structures. Note in particular that even
the &quot;safe&quot; functions may modify the global variable <i>errno</i>; the signal-catching function may want to save and restore its
value. The same principles apply to the async-signal-safety of application routines and asynchronous data access.</p>
<p class="tent">Note that although <a href="../functions/longjmp.html"><i>longjmp</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/siglongjmp.html"><i>siglongjmp</i>()</a> are in the list of async-signal-safe functions, there are restrictions on
subsequent behavior after the function is called from a signal-catching function. This is because the code executing after <a href=
"../functions/longjmp.html"><i>longjmp</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/siglongjmp.html"><i>siglongjmp</i>()</a> can call any
unsafe functions with the same danger as calling those unsafe functions directly from the signal handler. Applications that use
<a href="../functions/longjmp.html"><i>longjmp</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/siglongjmp.html"><i>siglongjmp</i>()</a> out of
signal handlers require rigorous protection in order to be portable. Many of the other functions that are excluded from the list
are traditionally implemented using either the C language <a href="../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/free.html"><i>free</i>()</a> functions or the ISO&nbsp;C standard I/O library, both of which traditionally use data
structures in a non-async-signal-safe manner. Because any combination of different functions using a common data structure can
cause async-signal-safety problems, POSIX.1 does not define the behavior when any unsafe function is called in (or after a <a href=
"../functions/longjmp.html"><i>longjmp</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/siglongjmp.html"><i>siglongjmp</i>()</a> out of) a signal
handler that interrupts any unsafe function or the non-async-signal-safe processing equivalent to <a href=
"../functions/exit.html"><i>exit</i>()</a> that is performed after return from the initial call to <i>main</i>().</p>
<p class="tent">The only realtime extension to signal actions is the addition of the additional parameters to the signal-catching
function. This extension has been explained and motivated in the previous section. In making this extension, though, developers of
POSIX.1b ran into issues relating to function prototypes. In response to input from the POSIX.1 standard developers, members were
added to the <b>sigaction</b> structure to specify function prototypes for the newer signal-catching function specified by
POSIX.1b. These members follow changes that are being made to POSIX.1. Note that POSIX.1-2024 explicitly states that these fields
may overlap so that a union can be defined. This enabled existing implementations of POSIX.1 to maintain binary-compatibility when
these extensions were added.</p>
<p class="tent">The <b>siginfo_t</b> structure was adopted for passing the application-defined value to match existing practice,
but the existing practice has no provision for an application-defined value, so this was added. Note that POSIX normally reserves
the &quot;_t&quot; type designation for opaque types. The <b>siginfo_t</b> structure breaks with this convention to follow existing
practice and thus promote portability.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1-2024 specifies several values for the <i>si_code</i> member of the <b>siginfo_t</b> structure. Some were
introduced in POSIX.1b; others were XSI functionality in the Single UNIX Specification, Version 2 and Version 3, that has now
become Base functionality. Historically, an <i>si_code</i> value of less than or equal to zero indicated that the signal was
generated by a process via the <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a> function, and values of <i>si_code</i> that
provided additional information for implementation-generated signals, such as SIGFPE or SIGSEGV, were all positive. This
functionality is partially specified for XSI systems in that if <i>si_code</i> is less than or equal to zero, the signal was
generated by a process. However, since POSIX.1b did not specify that SI_USER (or SI_QUEUE) had a value less than or equal to zero,
it is not true that when the signal is generated by a process, the value of <i>si_code</i> will always be less than or equal to
zero. XSI applications should check whether <i>si_code</i> is SI_USER or SI_QUEUE in addition to checking whether it is less than
or equal to zero. Applications on systems that do not support the XSI option should just check for SI_USER and SI_QUEUE.</p>
<p class="tent">If an implementation chooses to define additional values for <i>si_code</i>, these values have to be different from
the values of the non-signal-specific symbols specified by POSIX.1-2024. This will allow conforming applications to differentiate
between signals generated by standard events and those generated by other implementation events in a manner compatible with
existing practice.</p>
<p class="tent">The unique values of <i>si_code</i> for the POSIX.1b asynchronous events have implications for implementations of,
for example, asynchronous I/O or message passing in user space library code. Such an implementation will be required to provide a
hidden interface to the signal generation mechanism that allows the library to specify the standard values of <i>si_code</i>.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1-2024 also specifies additional members of <b>siginfo_t</b>, beyond those that were in POSIX.1b. Like the
<i>si_code</i> values mentioned above, these were XSI functionality in the Single UNIX Specification, Version 2 and Version 3, that
has now become Base functionality. They provide additional information when <i>si_code</i> has one of the values that moved from
XSI to Base.</p>
<p class="tent">Although it is not explicitly visible to applications, there are additional semantics for signal actions implied by
queued signals and their interaction with other POSIX.1b realtime functions. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">It is not necessary to queue signals whose action is SIG_IGN.</li>
<li class="tent">For implementations that support POSIX.1b timers, some interaction with the timer functions at signal delivery is
implied to manage the timer overrun count.</li>

<p class="tent">The most common behavior of an interrupted function after a signal-catching function returns is for the interrupted
function to give an [EINTR] error unless the SA_RESTART flag is in effect for the signal. However, there are a number of specific
exceptions, including <a href="../functions/sleep.html"><i>sleep</i>()</a> and certain situations with <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">The historical implementations of many functions defined by POSIX.1-2024 are not interruptible, but delay delivery
of signals generated during their execution until after they complete. This is never a problem for functions that are guaranteed to
complete in a short (imperceptible to a human) period of time. It is normally those functions that can suspend a process
indefinitely or for long periods of time (for example, <a href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pause.html"><i>pause</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/sigsuspend.html"><i>sigsuspend</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/sleep.html"><i>sleep</i>()</a>, or <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>/<a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> on a slow device like a terminal) that are interruptible. This permits applications to
respond to interactive signals or to set timeouts on calls to most such functions with <a href=
"../functions/alarm.html"><i>alarm</i>()</a>. Therefore, implementations should generally make such functions (including ones
defined as extensions) interruptible.</p>
<p class="tent">Functions not mentioned explicitly as interruptible may be so on some implementations, possibly as an extension
where the function gives an [EINTR] error. There are several functions (for example, <a href=
"../functions/getpid.html"><i>getpid</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getuid.html"><i>getuid</i>()</a>) that are specified as never
returning an error, which can thus never be extended in this way.</p>
<p class="tent">If a signal-catching function returns while the SA_RESTART flag is in effect, an interrupted function is restarted
at the point it was interrupted. Conforming applications cannot make assumptions about the internal behavior of interrupted
functions, even if the functions are async-signal-safe. For example, suppose the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>
function is interrupted with SA_RESTART in effect, the signal-catching function closes the file descriptor being read from and
returns, and the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> function is then restarted; in this case the application cannot
assume that the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> function will give an [EBADF] error, since <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> might have checked the file descriptor for validity before being interrupted.</p>

to read or write/alter the appropriate instance of one of the IPC mechanisms. All other relevant information is contained in the
reference pages themselves.</p>
<p class="tent">The semaphore type of IPC allows processes to communicate through the exchange of semaphore values. A semaphore is
a positive integer. Since many applications require the use of more than one semaphore, XSI-conformant systems have the ability to
create sets or arrays of semaphores.</p>

<p class="tent">Semaphore sets are created by using the <a href="../functions/semget.html"><i>semget</i>()</a> function.</p>
<p class="tent">The message type of IPC allows processes to communicate through the exchange of data stored in buffers. This data
is transmitted between processes in discrete portions known as messages.</p>

<p class="tent">The shared memory type of IPC allows two or more processes to share memory and consequently the data contained
therein. This is done by allowing processes to set up access to a common memory address space. This sharing of memory provides a
fast means of exchange of data between processes.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_22_02_08" id="tag_22_02_08"></a>B.2.8 Realtime</h4>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_01" id="tag_22_02_08_01"></a>Advisory Information</h5>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1b contains an Informative Annex with proposed interfaces for &quot;realtime files&quot;. These interfaces could
determine groups of the exact parameters required to do &quot;direct I/O&quot; or &quot;extents&quot;. These interfaces were objected to by a
significant portion of the balloting group as too complex. A conforming application had little chance of correctly navigating the
large parameter space to match its desires to the system. In addition, they only applied to a new type of file (realtime files) and
they told the implementation exactly what to do as opposed to advising the implementation on application behavior and letting it
optimize for the system the (portable) application was running on. For example, it was not clear how a system that had a disk array
should set its parameters.</p>
<p class="tent">There seemed to be several overall goals:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Optimizing sequential access</li>
<li class="tent">Optimizing caching behavior</li>
<li class="tent">Optimizing I/O data transfer</li>
<li class="tent">Preallocation</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">The advisory interfaces, <a href="../functions/posix_fadvise.html"><i>posix_fadvise</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/posix_madvise.html"><i>posix_madvise</i>()</a>, satisfy the first two goals. The POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL and
POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL advice tells the implementation to expect serial access. Typically the system will prefetch the next several
serial accesses in order to overlap I/O. It may also free previously accessed serial data if memory is tight. If the application is
not doing serial access it can use POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED and POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED to accomplish I/O overlap, as required. When the
application advises POSIX_FADV_RANDOM or POSIX_MADV_RANDOM behavior, the implementation usually tries to fetch a minimum amount of
data with each request and it does not expect much locality. POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED and POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED allow the system to free
up caching resources as the data will not be required in the near future.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE tells the system that caching the specified data is not optimal. For file I/O, the transfer
should go directly to the user buffer instead of being cached internally by the implementation. To portably perform direct disk I/O
on all systems, the application must perform its I/O transfers according to the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">The user buffer should be aligned according to the {POSIX_REC_XFER_ALIGN} <a href=
"../functions/pathconf.html"><i>pathconf</i>()</a> variable.</li>
<li class="tent">The number of bytes transferred in an I/O operation should be a multiple of the {POSIX_ALLOC_SIZE_MIN} <a href=
"../functions/pathconf.html"><i>pathconf</i>()</a> variable.</li>
<li class="tent">The offset into the file at the start of an I/O operation should be a multiple of the {POSIX_ALLOC_SIZE_MIN}
<a href="../functions/pathconf.html"><i>pathconf</i>()</a> variable.</li>
<li class="tent">The application should ensure that all threads which open a given file specify POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE to be sure that
there is no unexpected interaction between threads using buffered I/O and threads using direct I/O to the same file.</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">In some cases, a user buffer must be properly aligned in order to be transferred directly to/from the device. The
{POSIX_REC_XFER_ALIGN} <a href="../functions/pathconf.html"><i>pathconf</i>()</a> variable tells the application the proper
alignment.</p>
<p class="tent">The preallocation goal is met by the space control function, <a href=
"../functions/posix_fallocate.html"><i>posix_fallocate</i>()</a>. The application can use <a href=
"../functions/posix_fallocate.html"><i>posix_fallocate</i>()</a> to guarantee no [ENOSPC] errors and to improve performance by
prepaying any overhead required for block allocation.</p>
<p class="tent">Implementations may use information conveyed by a previous <a href=
"../functions/posix_fadvise.html"><i>posix_fadvise</i>()</a> call to influence the manner in which allocation is performed. For
example, if an application did the following calls:</p>
<pre>
<tt>fd = open("file");
posix_fadvise(fd, offset, len, POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL);
posix_fallocate(fd, len, size);
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">an implementation might allocate the file contiguously on disk.</p>
<p class="tent">Finally, the <a href="../functions/pathconf.html"><i>pathconf</i>()</a> variables {POSIX_REC_MIN_XFER_SIZE},
{POSIX_REC_MAX_XFER_SIZE}, and {POSIX_REC_INCR_XFER_SIZE} tell the application a range of transfer sizes that are recommended for
best I/O performance.</p>
<p class="tent">Where bounded response time is required, the vendor can supply the appropriate settings of the advisories to
achieve a guaranteed performance level.</p>
<p class="tent">The interfaces meet the goals while allowing applications using regular files to take advantage of performance
optimizations. The interfaces tell the implementation expected application behavior which the implementation can use to optimize
performance on a particular system with a particular dynamic load.</p>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/posix_memalign.html"><i>posix_memalign</i>()</a> function was added to allow for the
allocation of specifically aligned buffers; for example, for {POSIX_REC_XFER_ALIGN}.</p>
<p class="tent">The working group also considered the alternative of adding a function which would return an aligned pointer to
memory within a user-supplied buffer. This was not considered to be the best method, because it potentially wastes large amounts of
memory when buffers need to be aligned on large alignment boundaries.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_02" id="tag_22_02_08_02"></a>Message Passing</h5>
<p class="tent">This section provides the rationale for the definition of the message passing interface in POSIX.1-2024. This is
presented in terms of the objectives, models, and requirements imposed upon this interface.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Objectives
<p class="tent">Many applications, including both realtime and database applications, require a means of passing arbitrary amounts
of data between cooperating processes comprising the overall application on one or more processors. Many conventional interfaces
for interprocess communication are insufficient for realtime applications in that efficient and deterministic data passing methods
cannot be implemented. This has prompted the definition of message passing interfaces providing these facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Open a message queue.</li>
<li class="tent">Send a message to a message queue.</li>
<li class="tent">Receive a message from a queue, either synchronously or asynchronously.</li>
<li class="tent">Alter message queue attributes for flow and resource control.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">It is assumed that an application may consist of multiple cooperating processes and that these processes may wish
to communicate and coordinate their activities. The message passing facility described in POSIX.1-2024 allows processes to
communicate through system-wide queues. These message queues are accessed through names that may be pathnames. A message queue can
be opened for use by multiple sending and/or multiple receiving processes.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Background on Embedded Applications
<p class="tent">Interprocess communication utilizing message passing is a key facility for the construction of deterministic,
high-performance realtime applications. The facility is present in all realtime systems and is the framework upon which the
application is constructed. The performance of the facility is usually a direct indication of the performance of the resulting
application.</p>
<p class="tent">Realtime applications, especially for embedded systems, are typically designed around the performance constraints
imposed by the message passing mechanisms. Applications for embedded systems are typically very tightly constrained. Application
developers expect to design and control the entire system. In order to minimize system costs, the writer will attempt to use all
resources to their utmost and minimize the requirement to add additional memory or processors.</p>
<p class="tent">The embedded applications usually share address spaces and only a simple message passing mechanism is required. The
application can readily access common data incurring only mutual-exclusion overheads. The models desired are the simplest possible
with the application building higher-level facilities only when needed.<br></p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Requirements
<p class="tent">The following requirements determined the features of the message passing facilities defined in POSIX.1-2024:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Naming of Message Queues
<p class="tent">The mechanism for gaining access to a message queue is a pathname evaluated in a context that is allowed to be a
file system name space, or it can be independent of any file system. This is a specific attempt to allow implementations based on
either method in order to address both embedded systems and to also allow implementation in larger systems.</p>
<p class="tent">The interface of <a href="../functions/mq_open.html"><i>mq_open</i>()</a> is defined to allow but not require the
access control and name conflicts resulting from utilizing a file system for name resolution. All required behavior is specified
for the access control case. Yet a conforming implementation, such as an embedded system kernel, may define that there are no
distinctions between users and may define that all processes have all access privileges.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Embedded System Naming
<p class="tent">Embedded systems need to be able to utilize independent name spaces for accessing the various system objects. They
typically do not have a file system, precluding its utilization as a common name resolution mechanism. The modularity of an
embedded system limits the connections between separate mechanisms that can be allowed.</p>
<p class="tent">Embedded systems typically do not have any access protection. Since the system does not support the mixing of
applications from different areas, and usually does not even have the concept of an authorization entity, access control is not
useful.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Large System Naming
<p class="tent">On systems with more functionality, the name resolution must support the ability to use the file system as the name
resolution mechanism/object storage medium and to have control over access to the objects. Utilizing the pathname space can result
in further errors when the names conflict with other objects.<br></p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Fixed Size of Messages
<p class="tent">The interfaces impose a fixed upper bound on the size of messages that can be sent to a specific message queue. The
size is set on an individual queue basis and cannot be changed dynamically.</p>
<p class="tent">The purpose of the fixed size is to increase the ability of the system to optimize the implementation of <a href=
"../functions/mq_send.html"><i>mq_send</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/mq_receive.html"><i>mq_receive</i>()</a>. With fixed
sizes of messages and fixed numbers of messages, specific message blocks can be pre-allocated. This eliminates a significant amount
of checking for errors and boundary conditions. Additionally, an implementation can optimize data copying to maximize performance.
Finally, with a restricted range of message sizes, an implementation is better able to provide deterministic operations.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Prioritization of Messages
<p class="tent">Message prioritization allows the application to determine the order in which messages are received. Prioritization
of messages is a key facility that is provided by most realtime kernels and is heavily utilized by the applications. The major
purpose of having priorities in message queues is to avoid priority inversions in the message system, where a high-priority message
is delayed behind one or more lower-priority messages. This allows the applications to be designed so that they do not need to be
interrupted in order to change the flow of control when exceptional conditions occur. The prioritization does add additional
overhead to the message operations, in those cases it is actually used, but a clever implementation can optimize for the FIFO case
to make that more efficient.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Asynchronous Notification
<p class="tent">The interface supports the ability to have a task asynchronously notified of the availability of a message on the
queue. The purpose of this facility is to allow the task to perform other functions and yet still be notified that a message has
become available on the queue.</p>
<p class="tent">To understand the requirement for this function, it is useful to understand two models of application design: a
single task performing multiple functions and multiple tasks performing a single function. Each of these models has advantages.</p>
<p class="tent">Asynchronous notification is required to build the model of a single task performing multiple operations. This
model typically results from either the expectation that interruption is less expensive than utilizing a separate task or from the
growth of the application to include additional functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_03" id="tag_22_02_08_03"></a>Semaphores</h5>
<p class="tent">Semaphores are a high-performance process synchronization mechanism. Semaphores are named by null-terminated
strings of characters.</p>
<p class="tent">A semaphore is created using the <a href="../functions/sem_init.html"><i>sem_init</i>()</a> function or the
<a href="../functions/sem_open.html"><i>sem_open</i>()</a> function with the O_CREAT flag set in <i>oflag</i>.</p>
<p class="tent">To use a semaphore, a process has to first initialize the semaphore or inherit an open descriptor for the semaphore
via <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">A semaphore preserves its state when the last reference is closed. For example, if a semaphore has a value of 13
when the last reference is closed, it will have a value of 13 when it is next opened.</p>
<p class="tent">When a semaphore is created, an initial state for the semaphore has to be provided. This value is a non-negative
integer. Negative values are not possible since they indicate the presence of blocked processes. The persistence of any of these
objects across a system crash or a system reboot is undefined. Conforming applications must not depend on any sort of persistence
across a system reboot or a system crash.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Models and Requirements
<p class="tent">A realtime system requires synchronization and communication between the processes comprising the overall
application. An efficient and reliable synchronization mechanism has to be provided in a realtime system that will allow more than
one schedulable process mutually-exclusive access to the same resource. This synchronization mechanism has to allow for the optimal
implementation of synchronization or systems implementors will define other, more cost-effective methods.</p>
<p class="tent">At issue are the methods whereby multiple processes (tasks) can be designed and implemented to work together in
order to perform a single function. This requires interprocess communication and synchronization. A semaphore mechanism is the
lowest level of synchronization that can be provided by an operating system.</p>
<p class="tent">A semaphore is defined as an object that has an integral value and a set of blocked processes associated with it.
If the value is positive or zero, then the set of blocked processes is empty; otherwise, the size of the set is equal to the
absolute value of the semaphore value. The value of the semaphore can be incremented or decremented by any process with access to
the semaphore and must be done as an indivisible operation. When a semaphore value is less than or equal to zero, any process that
attempts to lock it again will block or be informed that it is not possible to perform the operation.</p>
<p class="tent">A semaphore may be used to guard access to any resource accessible by more than one schedulable task in the system.
It is a global entity and not associated with any particular process. As such, a method of obtaining access to the semaphore has to
be provided by the operating system. A process that wants access to a critical resource (section) has to wait on the semaphore that
guards that resource. When the semaphore is locked on behalf of a process, it knows that it can utilize the resource without
interference by any other cooperating process in the system. When the process finishes its operation on the resource, leaving it in
a well-defined state, it posts the semaphore, indicating that some other process may now obtain the resource associated with that
semaphore.</p>
<p class="tent">In this section, mutexes and condition variables are specified as the synchronization mechanisms between
threads.</p>
<p class="tent">These primitives are typically used for synchronizing threads that share memory in a single process. However, this
section provides an option allowing the use of these synchronization interfaces and objects between processes that share memory,
regardless of the method for sharing memory.</p>
<p class="tent">Much experience with semaphores shows that there are two distinct uses of synchronization: locking, which is
typically of short duration; and waiting, which is typically of long or unbounded duration. These distinct usages map directly onto
mutexes and condition variables, respectively.</p>
<p class="tent">Semaphores are provided in POSIX.1-2024 primarily to provide a means of synchronization for processes; these
processes may or may not share memory. Mutexes and condition variables are specified as synchronization mechanisms between threads;
these threads always share (some) memory. Both are synchronization paradigms that have been in widespread use for a number of
years. Each set of primitives is particularly well matched to certain problems.</p>
<p class="tent">With respect to binary semaphores, experience has shown that condition variables and mutexes are easier to use for
many synchronization problems than binary semaphores. The primary reason for this is the explicit appearance of a Boolean predicate
that specifies when the condition wait is satisfied. This Boolean predicate terminates a loop, including the call to <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_wait.html"><i>pthread_cond_wait</i>()</a>. As a result, extra wakeups are benign since the predicate
governs whether the thread will actually proceed past the condition wait. With stateful primitives, such as binary semaphores, the
wakeup in itself typically means that the wait is satisfied. The burden of ensuring correctness for such waits is thus placed on
<i>all</i> signalers of the semaphore rather than on an <i>explicitly coded</i> Boolean predicate located at the condition wait.
Experience has shown that the latter creates a major improvement in safety and ease-of-use.</p>
<p class="tent">Counting semaphores are well matched to dealing with producer/consumer problems, including those that might exist
between threads of different processes, or between a signal handler and a thread. In the former case, there may be little or no
memory shared by the processes; in the latter case, one is not communicating between co-equal threads, but between a thread and an
interrupt-like entity. It is for these reasons that POSIX.1-2024 allows semaphores to be used by threads.</p>
<p class="tent">Mutexes and condition variables have been effectively used with and without priority inheritance, priority ceiling,
and other attributes to synchronize threads that share memory. The efficiency of their implementation is comparable to or better
than that of other synchronization primitives that are sometimes harder to use (for example, binary semaphores). Furthermore, there
is at least one known implementation of Ada tasking that uses these primitives. Mutexes and condition variables together constitute
an appropriate, sufficient, and complete set of inter-thread synchronization primitives.</p>
<p class="tent">Efficient multi-threaded applications require high-performance synchronization primitives. Considerations of
efficiency and generality require a small set of primitives upon which more sophisticated synchronization functions can be
built.<br></p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Standardization Issues
<p class="tent">It is possible to implement very high-performance semaphores using test-and-set instructions on shared memory
locations. The library routines that implement such a high-performance interface have to properly ensure that a <a href=
"../functions/sem_wait.html"><i>sem_wait</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/sem_trywait.html"><i>sem_trywait</i>()</a> operation
that cannot be performed will issue a blocking semaphore system call or properly report the condition to the application. The same
interface to the application program would be provided by a high-performance implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_08_04" id="tag_22_02_08_04"></a>B.2.8.1 Realtime Signals</h5>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_05" id="tag_22_02_08_05"></a>Realtime Signals Extension</h5>
<p class="tent">This portion of the rationale presents models, requirements, and standardization issues relevant to the Realtime
Signals Extension. This extension provides the capability required to support reliable, deterministic, asynchronous notification of
events. While a new mechanism, unencumbered by the historical usage and semantics of POSIX.1 signals, might allow for a more
efficient implementation, the application requirements for event notification can be met with a small number of extensions to
signals. Therefore, a minimal set of extensions to signals to support the application requirements is specified.</p>
<p class="tent">The realtime signal extensions specified in this section are used by other realtime functions requiring
asynchronous notification:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Models
<p class="tent">The model supported is one of multiple cooperating processes, each of which handles multiple asynchronous external
events. Events represent occurrences that are generated as the result of some activity in the system. Examples of occurrences that
can constitute an event include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Completion of an asynchronous I/O request</li>
<li class="tent">Expiration of a POSIX.1b timer</li>
<li class="tent">Arrival of an interprocess message</li>
<li class="tent">Generation of a user-defined event</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">Processing of these events may occur synchronously via polling for event notifications or asynchronously via a
software interrupt mechanism. Existing practice for this model is well established for traditional proprietary realtime operating
systems, realtime executives, and realtime extended POSIX-like systems.</p>
<p class="tent">A contrasting model is that of &quot;cooperating sequential processes&quot; where each process handles a single priority of
events via polling. Each process blocks while waiting for events, and each process depends on the preemptive, priority-based
process scheduling mechanism to arbitrate between events of different priority that need to be processed concurrently. Existing
practice for this model is also well established for small realtime executives that typically execute in an unprotected physical
address space, but it is just emerging in the context of a fuller function operating system with multiple virtual address
spaces.</p>
<p class="tent">It could be argued that the cooperating sequential process model, and the facilities supported by the POSIX Threads
Extension obviate a software interrupt model. But, even with the cooperating sequential process model, the need has been recognized
for a software interrupt model to handle exceptional conditions and process aborting, so the mechanism must be supported in any
case. Furthermore, it is not the purview of POSIX.1-2024 to attempt to convince realtime practitioners that their current
application models based on software interrupts are &quot;broken&quot; and should be replaced by the cooperating sequential process model.
Rather, it is the charter of POSIX.1-2024 to provide standard extensions to mechanisms that support existing realtime practice.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Requirements
<p class="tent">This section discusses the following realtime application requirements for asynchronous event notification:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Reliable delivery of asynchronous event notification
<p class="tent">The events notification mechanism guarantees delivery of an event notification. Asynchronous operations (such as
asynchronous I/O and timers) that complete significantly after they are invoked have to guarantee that delivery of the event
notification can occur at the time of completion.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Prioritized handling of asynchronous event notifications
<p class="tent">The events notification mechanism supports the assigning of a user function as an event notification handler.
Furthermore, the mechanism supports the preemption of an event handler function by a higher priority event notification and
supports the selection of the highest priority pending event notification when multiple notifications (of different priority) are
pending simultaneously.</p>
<p class="tent">The model here is based on hardware interrupts. Asynchronous event handling allows the application to ensure that
time-critical events are immediately processed when delivered, without the indeterminism of being at a random location within a
polling loop. Use of handler priority allows the specification of how handlers are interrupted by other higher priority
handlers.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Differentiation between multiple occurrences of event notifications of the same type
<p class="tent">The events notification mechanism passes an application-defined value to the event handler function. This value can
be used for a variety of purposes, such as enabling the application to identify which of several possible events of the same type
(for example, timer expirations) has occurred.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Polled reception of asynchronous event notifications
<p class="tent">The events notification mechanism supports blocking and non-blocking polls for asynchronous event notification.</p>
<p class="tent">The polled mode of operation is often preferred over the interrupt mode by those practitioners accustomed to this
model. Providing support for this model facilitates the porting of applications based on this model to POSIX.1b conforming
systems.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Deterministic response to asynchronous event notifications
<p class="tent">The events notification mechanism does not preclude implementations that provide deterministic event dispatch
latency and minimizes the number of system calls needed to use the event facilities during realtime processing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br></li>
<li class="tent">Rationale for Extension
<p class="tent">POSIX.1 signals have many of the characteristics necessary to support the asynchronous handling of event
notifications, and the Realtime Signals Extension addresses the following deficiencies in the POSIX.1 signal mechanism:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Signals do not support reliable delivery of event notification. Subsequent occurrences of a pending signal are not
guaranteed to be delivered.</li>
<li class="tent">Signals do not support prioritized delivery of event notifications. The order of signal delivery when multiple
unblocked signals are pending is undefined.</li>
<li class="tent">Signals do not support the differentiation between multiple signals of the same type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_08_06" id="tag_22_02_08_06"></a>B.2.8.2 Asynchronous I/O</h5>
<p class="tent">Many applications need to interact with the I/O subsystem in an asynchronous manner. The asynchronous I/O mechanism
provides the ability to overlap application processing and I/O operations initiated by the application. The asynchronous I/O
mechanism allows a single process to perform I/O simultaneously to a single file multiple times or to multiple files multiple
times.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_07" id="tag_22_02_08_07"></a>Overview</h5>
<p class="tent">Asynchronous I/O operations proceed in logical parallel with the processing done by the application after the
asynchronous I/O has been initiated. Other than this difference, asynchronous I/O behaves similarly to normal I/O using <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/lseek.html"><i>lseek</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/fsync.html"><i>fsync</i>()</a>. The effect of issuing an
asynchronous I/O request is as if a separate thread of execution were to perform atomically the implied <a href=
"../functions/lseek.html"><i>lseek</i>()</a> operation, if any, and then the requested I/O operation (either <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>, or <a href=
"../functions/fsync.html"><i>fsync</i>()</a>). There is no seek implied with a call to <a href=
"../functions/aio_fsync.html"><i>aio_fsync</i>()</a>. Concurrent asynchronous operations and synchronous operations applied to the
same file update the file as if the I/O operations had proceeded serially.</p>
<p class="tent">When asynchronous I/O completes, a signal can be delivered to the application to indicate the completion of the
I/O. This signal can be used to indicate that buffers and control blocks used for asynchronous I/O can be reused. Signal delivery
is not required for an asynchronous operation and may be turned off on a per-operation basis by the application. Signals may also
be synchronously polled using <a href="../functions/aio_suspend.html"><i>aio_suspend</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/sigtimedwait.html"><i>sigtimedwait</i>()</a>, or <a href=
"../functions/sigwaitinfo.html"><i>sigwaitinfo</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">Normal I/O has a return value and an error status associated with it. Asynchronous I/O returns a value and an error
status when the operation is first submitted, but that only relates to whether the operation was successfully queued up for
servicing. The I/O operation itself also has a return status and an error value. To allow the application to retrieve the return
status and the error value, functions are provided that, given the address of an asynchronous I/O control block, yield the return
and error status associated with the operation. Until an asynchronous I/O operation is done, its error status is [EINPROGRESS].
Thus, an application can poll for completion of an asynchronous I/O operation by waiting for the error status to become equal to a
value other than [EINPROGRESS]. The return status of an asynchronous I/O operation is undefined so long as the error status is
equal to [EINPROGRESS].</p>
<p class="tent">Storage for asynchronous operation return and error status may be limited. Submission of asynchronous I/O
operations may fail if this storage is exceeded. When an application retrieves the return status of a given asynchronous operation,
therefore, any system-maintained storage used for this status and the error status may be reclaimed for use by other asynchronous
operations.</p>
<p class="tent">Asynchronous I/O can be performed on file descriptors that have been enabled for POSIX.1b synchronized I/O. In this
case, the I/O operation still occurs asynchronously, as defined herein; however, the asynchronous operation I/O in this case is not
completed until the I/O has reached either the state of synchronized I/O data integrity completion or synchronized I/O file
integrity completion, depending on the sort of synchronized I/O that is enabled on the file descriptor.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_08" id="tag_22_02_08_08"></a>Models</h5>
<p class="tent">Three models illustrate the use of asynchronous I/O: a journalization model, a data acquisition model, and a model
of the use of asynchronous I/O in supercomputing applications.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Journalization Model
<p class="tent">Many realtime applications perform low-priority journalizing functions. Journalizing requires that logging records
be queued for output without blocking the initiating process.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Data Acquisition Model
<p class="tent">A data acquisition process may also serve as a model. The process has two or more channels delivering intermittent
data that must be read within a certain time. The process issues one asynchronous read on each channel. When one of the channels
needs data collection, the process reads the data and posts it through an asynchronous write to secondary memory for future
processing.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Supercomputing Model
<p class="tent">The supercomputing community has used asynchronous I/O much like that specified in POSIX.1 for many years. This
community requires the ability to perform multiple I/O operations to multiple devices with a minimal number of entries to &quot;the
system&quot;; each entry to &quot;the system&quot; provokes a major delay in operations when compared to the normal progress made by the
application. This existing practice motivated the use of combined <a href="../functions/lseek.html"><i>lseek</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> calls, as well as the <a href=
"../functions/lio_listio.html"><i>lio_listio</i>()</a> call. Another common practice is to disable signal notification for I/O
completion, and simply poll for I/O completion at some interval by which the I/O should be completed. Likewise, interfaces like
<a href="../functions/aio_cancel.html"><i>aio_cancel</i>()</a> have been in successful commercial use for many years. Note also
that an underlying implementation of asynchronous I/O will require the ability, at least internally, to cancel outstanding
asynchronous I/O, at least when the process exits. (Consider an asynchronous read from a terminal, when the process intends to exit
immediately.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_09" id="tag_22_02_08_09"></a>Requirements</h5>
<p class="tent">Asynchronous input and output for realtime implementations have these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">The ability to queue multiple asynchronous read and write operations to a single open instance. Both sequential
and random access should be supported.</li>
<li class="tent">The ability to queue asynchronous read and write operations to multiple open instances.</li>
<li class="tent">The ability to obtain completion status information by polling and/or asynchronous event notification.</li>
<li class="tent">Asynchronous event notification on asynchronous I/O completion is optional.</li>
<li class="tent">It has to be possible for the application to associate the event with the <i>aiocbp</i> for the operation that
generated the event.</li>
<li class="tent">The ability to cancel queued requests.</li>
<li class="tent">The ability to wait upon asynchronous I/O completion in conjunction with other types of events.</li>

asynchronous.</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_10" id="tag_22_02_08_10"></a>Standardization Issues</h5>
<p class="tent">The following issues are addressed by the standardization of asynchronous I/O:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Rationale for New Interface
<p class="tent">Non-blocking I/O does not satisfy the needs of either realtime or high-performance computing models; these models
require that a process overlap program execution and I/O processing. Realtime applications will often make use of direct I/O to or
from the address space of the process, or require synchronized (unbuffered) I/O; they also require the ability to overlap this I/O
with other computation. In addition, asynchronous I/O allows an application to keep a device busy at all times, possibly achieving
greater throughput. Supercomputing and database architectures will often have specialized hardware that can provide true asynchrony
underlying the logical asynchrony provided by this interface. In addition, asynchronous I/O should be supported by all types of
files and devices in the same manner.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Effect of Buffering
<p class="tent">If asynchronous I/O is performed on a file that is buffered prior to being actually written to the device, it is
possible that asynchronous I/O will offer no performance advantage over normal I/O; the cycles <i>stolen</i> to perform the
asynchronous I/O will be taken away from the running process and the I/O will occur at interrupt time. This potential lack of gain
in performance in no way obviates the need for asynchronous I/O by realtime applications, which very often will use specialized
hardware support, multiple processors, and/or unbuffered, synchronized I/O.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_08_11" id="tag_22_02_08_11"></a>B.2.8.3 Memory Management</h5>
<p class="tent">All memory management and shared memory definitions are located in the <a href=
"../basedefs/sys_mman.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i></a> header. This is for alignment with historical practice.</p>
<p class="tent">IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001/Cor&nbsp;1-2002, item XSH/TC1/D6/7 is applied, correcting the shading and margin
markers in the introduction to Section 2.8.3.1.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_12" id="tag_22_02_08_12"></a>Memory Locking Functions</h5>
<p class="tent">This portion of the rationale presents models, requirements, and standardization issues relevant to process memory
locking.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Models
<p class="tent">Realtime systems that conform to POSIX.1-2024 are expected (and desired) to be supported on systems with
demand-paged virtual memory management, non-paged swapping memory management, and physical memory systems with no memory management
hardware. The general case, however, is the demand-paged, virtual memory system with each POSIX process running in a virtual
address space. Note that this includes architectures where each process resides in its own virtual address space and architectures
where the address space of each process is only a portion of a larger global virtual address space.</p>
<p class="tent">The concept of memory locking is introduced to eliminate the indeterminacy introduced by paging and swapping, and
to support an upper bound on the time required to access the memory mapped into the address space of a process. Ideally, this upper
bound will be the same as the time required for the processor to access &quot;main memory&quot;, including any address translation and
cache miss overheads. But some implementationsâprimarily on mainframesâwill not actually force locked pages to be loaded and held
resident in main memory. Rather, they will handle locked pages so that accesses to these pages will meet the performance metrics
for locked process memory in the implementation. Also, although it is not, for example, the intention that this interface, as
specified, be used to lock process memory into &quot;cache&quot;, it is conceivable that an implementation could support a large static RAM
memory and define this as &quot;main memory&quot; and use a large[r] dynamic RAM as &quot;backing store&quot;. These interfaces could then be
interpreted as supporting the locking of process memory into the static RAM. Support for multiple levels of backing store would
require extensions to these interfaces.</p>
<p class="tent">Implementations may also use memory locking to guarantee a fixed translation between virtual and physical addresses
where such is beneficial to improving determinacy for direct-to/from-process input/output. POSIX.1-2024 does not guarantee to the
application that the virtual-to-physical address translations, if such exist, are fixed, because such behavior would not be
implementable on all architectures on which implementations of POSIX.1-2024 are expected. But POSIX.1-2024 does mandate that an
implementation define, for the benefit of potential users, whether or not locking guarantees fixed translations.</p>
<p class="tent">Memory locking is defined with respect to the address space of a process. Only the pages mapped into the address
space of a process may be locked by the process, and when the pages are no longer mapped into the address spaceâfor whatever
reasonâthe locks established with respect to that address space are removed. Shared memory areas warrant special mention, as they
may be mapped into more than one address space or mapped more than once into the address space of a process; locks may be
established on pages within these areas with respect to several of these mappings. In such a case, the lock state of the underlying
physical pages is the logical OR of the lock state with respect to each of the mappings. Only when all such locks have been removed
are the shared pages considered unlocked.</p>
<p class="tent">In recognition of the page granularity of Memory Management Units (MMU), and in order to support locking of ranges
of address space, memory locking is defined in terms of &quot;page&quot; granularity. That is, for the interfaces that support an address
and size specification for the region to be locked, the address must be on a page boundary, and all pages mapped by the specified
range are locked, if valid. This means that the length is implicitly rounded up to a multiple of the page size. The page size is
implementation-defined and is available to applications as a compile-time symbolic constant or at runtime via <a href=
"../functions/sysconf.html"><i>sysconf</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">A &quot;real memory&quot; POSIX.1b implementation that has no MMU could elect not to support these interfaces, returning
[ENOSYS]. But an application could easily interpret this as meaning that the implementation would unconditionally page or swap the
application when such is not the case. It is the intention of POSIX.1-2024 that such a system could define these interfaces as
&quot;NO-OPs&quot;, returning success without actually performing any function except for mandated argument checking.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Requirements
<p class="tent">For realtime applications, memory locking is generally considered to be required as part of application
initialization. This locking is performed after an application has been loaded (that is, <i>exec</i>'d) and the program remains
locked for its entire lifetime. But to support applications that undergo major mode changes where, in one mode, locking is
required, but in another it is not, the specified interfaces allow repeated locking and unlocking of memory within the lifetime of
a process.</p>
<p class="tent">When a realtime application locks its address space, it should not be necessary for the application to then
&quot;touch&quot; all of the pages in the address space to guarantee that they are resident or else suffer potential paging delays the
first time the page is referenced. Thus, POSIX.1-2024 requires that the pages locked by the specified interfaces be resident when
the locking functions return successfully.</p>
<p class="tent">Many architectures support system-managed stacks that grow automatically when the current extent of the stack is
exceeded. A realtime application has a requirement to be able to &quot;preallocate&quot; sufficient stack space and lock it down so that it
will not suffer page faults to grow the stack during critical realtime operation. There was no consensus on a portable way to
specify how much stack space is needed, so POSIX.1-2024 supports no specific interface for preallocating stack space. But an
application can portably lock down a specific amount of stack space by specifying MCL_FUTURE in a call to <a href=
"../functions/mlockall.html"><i>mlockall</i>()</a> and then calling a dummy function that declares an automatic array of the
desired size.</p>
<p class="tent">Memory locking for realtime applications is also generally considered to be an &quot;all or nothing&quot; proposition. That
is, the entire process, or none, is locked down. But, for applications that have well-defined sections that need to be locked and
others that do not, POSIX.1-2024 supports an optional set of interfaces to lock or unlock a range of process addresses. Reasons for
locking down a specific range include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">An asynchronous event handler function that must respond to external events in a deterministic manner such that
page faults cannot be tolerated</li>
<li class="tent">An input/output &quot;buffer&quot; area that is the target for direct-to-process I/O, and the overhead of implicit locking
and unlocking for each I/O call cannot be tolerated</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">Finally, locking is generally viewed as an &quot;application-wide&quot; function. That is, the application is globally
aware of which regions are locked and which are not over time. This is in contrast to a function that is used temporarily within a
&quot;third party&quot; library routine whose function is unknown to the application, and therefore must have no &quot;side-effects&quot;. The
specified interfaces, therefore, do not support &quot;lock stacking&quot; or &quot;lock nesting&quot; within a process. But, for pages that are
shared between processes or mapped more than once into a process address space, &quot;lock stacking&quot; is essentially mandated by the
requirement that unlocking of pages that are mapped by more that one process or more than once by the same process does not affect
locks established on the other mappings.</p>
<p class="tent">There was some support for &quot;lock stacking&quot; so that locking could be transparently used in functions or opaque
modules. But the consensus was not to burden all implementations with lock stacking (and reference counting), and an implementation
option was proposed. There were strong objections to the option because applications would have to support both options in order to
remain portable. The consensus was to eliminate lock stacking altogether, primarily through overwhelming support for the
System&nbsp;V &quot;m[un]lock[all]&quot; interface on which POSIX.1-2024 is now based.</p>
<p class="tent">Locks are not inherited across <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>s because some implementations
implement <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> by creating new address spaces for the child. In such an
implementation, requiring locks to be inherited would lead to new situations in which a fork would fail due to the inability of the
system to lock sufficient memory to lock both the parent and the child. The consensus was that there was no benefit to such
inheritance. Note that this does not mean that locks are removed when, for instance, a thread is created in the same address
space.</p>
<p class="tent">Similarly, locks are not inherited across <i>exec</i> because some implementations implement <i>exec</i> by
unmapping all of the pages in the address space (which, by definition, removes the locks on these pages), and maps in pages of the
<i>exec</i>'d image. In such an implementation, requiring locks to be inherited would lead to new situations in which <i>exec</i>
would fail. Reporting this failure would be very cumbersome to detect in time to report to the calling process, and no appropriate
mechanism exists for informing the <i>exec</i>'d process of its status.</p>
<p class="tent">It was determined that, if the newly loaded application required locking, it was the responsibility of that
application to establish the locks. This is also in keeping with the general view that it is the responsibility of the application
to be aware of all locks that are established.</p>
<p class="tent">There was one request to allow (not mandate) locks to be inherited across <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>, and a request for a flag, MCL_INHERIT, that would specify inheritance of memory locks
across <i>exec</i>s. Given the difficulties raised by this and the general lack of support for the feature in POSIX.1-2024, it was
not added. POSIX.1-2024 does not preclude an implementation from providing this feature for administrative purposes, such as a
&quot;run&quot; command that will lock down and execute a specified application. Additionally, the rationale for the objection equated
<a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> with creating a thread in the address space. POSIX.1-2024 does not mandate
releasing locks when creating additional threads in an existing process.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Standardization Issues
<p class="tent">One goal of POSIX.1-2024 is to define a set of primitives that provide the necessary functionality for realtime
applications, with consideration for the needs of other application domains where such were identified, which is based to the
extent possible on existing industry practice.</p>
<p class="tent">The Memory Locking option is required by many realtime applications to tune performance. Such a facility is
accomplished by placing constraints on the virtual memory system to limit paging of time of the process or of critical sections of
the process. This facility should not be used by most non-realtime applications.</p>
<p class="tent">Optional features provided in POSIX.1-2024 allow applications to lock selected address ranges with the caveat that
the process is responsible for being aware of the page granularity of locking and the unnested nature of the locks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_13" id="tag_22_02_08_13"></a>Mapped Files Functions</h5>
<p class="tent">The memory mapped files functionality provides a mechanism that allows a process to access files by directly
incorporating file data into its address space. Once a file is &quot;mapped&quot; into a process address space, the data can be manipulated
by instructions as memory. The use of mapped files can significantly reduce I/O data movement since file data does not have to be
copied into process data buffers as in <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>. If more than one process maps a file, its contents are shared among them. This
provides a low overhead mechanism by which processes can synchronize and communicate.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Historical Perspective
<p class="tent">Realtime applications have historically been implemented using a collection of cooperating processes or tasks. In
early systems, these processes ran on bare hardware (that is, without an operating system) with no memory relocation or protection.
The application paradigms that arose from this environment involve the sharing of data between the processes.</p>
<p class="tent">When realtime systems were implemented on top of vendor-supplied operating systems, the paradigm or performance
benefits of direct access to data by multiple processes was still deemed necessary. As a result, operating systems that claim to
support realtime applications must support the shared memory paradigm.</p>
<p class="tent">Additionally, a number of realtime systems provide the ability to map specific sections of the physical address
space into the address space of a process. This ability is required if an application is to obtain direct access to memory
locations that have specific properties (for example, refresh buffers or display devices, dual ported memory locations, DMA target
locations). The use of this ability is common enough to warrant some degree of standardization of its interface. This ability
overlaps the general paradigm of shared memory in that, in both instances, common global objects are made addressable by individual
processes or tasks.</p>
<p class="tent">Finally, a number of systems also provide the ability to map process addresses to files. This provides both a
general means of sharing persistent objects, and using files in a manner that optimizes memory and swapping space usage.</p>
<p class="tent">Simple shared memory is clearly a special case of the more general file mapping capability. In addition, there is
relatively widespread agreement and implementation of the file mapping interface. In these systems, many different types of objects
can be mapped (for example, files, memory, devices, and so on) using the same mapping interfaces. This approach both minimizes
interface proliferation and maximizes the generality of programs using the mapping interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Memory Mapped Files Usage
<p class="tent">A memory object can be concurrently mapped into the address space of one or more processes. The <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a> functions allow a process to
manipulate their address space by mapping portions of memory objects into it and removing them from it. When multiple processes map
the same memory object, they can share access to the underlying data. Implementations may restrict the size and alignment of
mappings to be on <i>page</i>-size boundaries. The page size, in bytes, is the value of the system-configurable variable
{PAGESIZE}, typically accessed by calling <a href="../functions/sysconf.html"><i>sysconf</i>()</a> with a <i>name</i> argument of
_SC_PAGESIZE. If an implementation has no restrictions on size or alignment, it may specify a 1-byte page size.</p>
<p class="tent">To map memory, a process first opens a memory object. The <a href=
"../functions/ftruncate.html"><i>ftruncate</i>()</a> function can be used to contract or extend the size of the memory object even
when the object is currently mapped. If the memory object is extended, the contents of the extended areas are zeros.</p>
<p class="tent">After opening a memory object, the application maps the object into its address space using the <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> function call. Once a mapping has been established, it remains mapped until unmapped
with <a href="../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a>, even if the memory object is closed. The <a href=
"../functions/mprotect.html"><i>mprotect</i>()</a> function can be used to change the memory protections initially established by
<a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">A <a href="../functions/close.html"><i>close</i>()</a> of the file descriptor, while invalidating the file
descriptor itself, does not unmap any mappings established for the memory object. The address space, including all mapped regions,
is inherited on <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>. The entire address space is unmapped on process termination or
by successful calls to any of the <i>exec</i> family of functions.</p>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/msync.html"><i>msync</i>()</a> function is used to force mapped file data to permanent
storage.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Effects on Other Functions
<p class="tent">With memory mapped files, the operation of the <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/creat.html"><i>creat</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/unlink.html"><i>unlink</i>()</a> functions are a natural
result of using the file system name space to map the global names for memory objects.</p>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/ftruncate.html"><i>ftruncate</i>()</a> function can be used to set the length of a
sharable memory object.</p>
<p class="tent">The meaning of <a href="../functions/stat.html"><i>stat</i>()</a> fields other than the size and protection
information is undefined on implementations where memory objects are not implemented using regular files. When regular files are
used, the times reflect when the implementation updated the file image of the data, not when a process updated the data in
memory.</p>
<p class="tent">The operations of <a href="../functions/fdopen.html"><i>fdopen</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/lseek.html"><i>lseek</i>()</a> were made unspecified for objects opened with <a href=
"../functions/shm_open.html"><i>shm_open</i>()</a>, so that implementations that did not implement memory objects as regular files
would not have to support the operation of these functions on shared memory objects.</p>
<p class="tent">The behavior of memory objects with respect to <a href="../functions/close.html"><i>close</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/dup.html"><i>dup</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/dup2.html"><i>dup2</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/dup3.html"><i>dup3</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/close.html"><i>close</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/_exit.html"><i>_exit</i>()</a>, and the <i>exec</i> family of functions is the same as the behavior of the existing
practice of the <a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> function.</p>
<p class="tent">A memory object can still be referenced after a close. That is, any mappings made to the file are still in effect,
and reads and writes that are made to those mappings are still valid and are shared with other processes that have the same
mapping. Likewise, the memory object can still be used if any references remain after its name(s) have been deleted. Any references
that remain after a close must not appear to the application as file descriptors.</p>
<p class="tent">This is existing practice for <a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/close.html"><i>close</i>()</a>. In addition, there are already mappings present (text, data, stack) that do not have
open file descriptors. The text mapping in particular is considered a reference to the file containing the text. The desire was to
treat all mappings by the process uniformly. Also, many modern implementations use <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> to implement shared libraries, and it would not be desirable to keep file descriptors
for each of the many libraries an application can use. It was felt there were many other existing programs that used this behavior
to free a file descriptor, and thus POSIX.1-2024 could not forbid it and still claim to be using existing practice.</p>
<p class="tent">For implementations that implement memory objects using memory only, memory objects will retain the memory
allocated to the file after the last close and will use that same memory on the next open. Note that closing the memory object is
not the same as deleting the name, since the memory object is still defined in the memory object name space.</p>
<p class="tent">The locks of <a href="../functions/fcntl.html"><i>fcntl</i>()</a> do not block any read or write operation,
including read or write access to shared memory or mapped files. In addition, implementations that only support shared memory
objects should not be required to implement record locks. The reference to <a href="../functions/fcntl.html"><i>fcntl</i>()</a> is
added to make this point explicitly. The other <a href="../functions/fcntl.html"><i>fcntl</i>()</a> commands are useful with shared
memory objects.</p>
<p class="tent">The size of pages that mapping hardware may be able to support may be a configurable value, or it may change based
on hardware implementations. The addition of the _SC_PAGESIZE parameter to the <a href=
"../functions/sysconf.html"><i>sysconf</i>()</a> function is provided for determining the mapping page size at runtime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_14" id="tag_22_02_08_14"></a>Shared Memory Functions</h5>
<p class="tent">Implementations may support the Shared Memory Objects option independently of memory mapped files. Shared memory
objects are named regions of storage that may be independent of the file system and can be mapped into the address space of one or
more processes to allow them to share the associated memory.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Requirements
<p class="tent">Shared memory is used to share data among several processes, each potentially running at different priority levels,
responding to different inputs, or performing separate tasks. Shared memory is not just simply providing common access to data, it
is providing the fastest possible communication between the processes. With one memory write operation, a process can pass
information to as many processes as have the memory region mapped.</p>
<p class="tent">As a result, shared memory provides a mechanism that can be used for all other interprocess communication
facilities. It may also be used by an application for implementing more sophisticated mechanisms than semaphores and message
queues.</p>
<p class="tent">The need for a shared memory interface is obvious for virtual memory systems, where the operating system is
directly preventing processes from accessing each other's data. However, in unprotected systems, such as those found in some
embedded controllers, a shared memory interface is needed to provide a portable mechanism to allocate a region of memory to be
shared and then to communicate the address of that region to other processes.</p>
<p class="tent">This, then, provides the minimum functionality that a shared memory interface must have in order to support
realtime applications: to allocate and name an object to be mapped into memory for potential sharing (<a href=
"../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/shm_open.html"><i>shm_open</i>()</a>), and to make the memory
object available within the address space of a process (<a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a>). To complete the
interface, a mechanism to release the claim of a process on a shared memory object (<a href=
"../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a>) is also needed, as well as a mechanism for deleting the name of a sharable object
that was previously created (<a href="../functions/unlink.html"><i>unlink</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/shm_unlink.html"><i>shm_unlink</i>()</a>).</p>
<p class="tent">After a mapping has been established, an implementation should not have to provide services to maintain that
mapping. All memory writes into that area will appear immediately in the memory mapping of that region by any other processes.</p>
<p class="tent">Thus, requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Support creation of sharable memory objects and the mapping of these objects into the address space of a
process.</li>
<li class="tent">Sharable memory objects should be accessed by global names accessible from all processes.</li>
<li class="tent">Support the mapping of specific sections of physical address space (such as a memory mapped device) into the
address space of a process. This should not be done by the process specifying the actual address, but again by an
implementation-defined global name (such as a special device name) dedicated to this purpose.</li>
<li class="tent">Support the mapping of discrete portions of these memory objects.</li>
<li class="tent">Support for minimum hardware configurations that contain no physical media on which to store shared memory
contents permanently.</li>
<li class="tent">The ability to preallocate the entire shared memory region so that minimum hardware configurations without virtual
memory support can guarantee contiguous space.</li>
<li class="tent">The maximizing of performance by not requiring functionality that would require implementation interaction above
creating the shared memory area and returning the mapping.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">Note that the above requirements do not preclude:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">The sharable memory object from being implemented using actual files on an actual file system.</li>
<li class="tent">The global name that is accessible from all processes being restricted to a file system area that is dedicated to
handling shared memory.</li>
<li class="tent">An implementation not providing implementation-defined global names for the purpose of physical address
mapping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="tent">Shared Memory Objects Usage
<p class="tent">If the Shared Memory Objects option is supported, a shared memory object may be created, or opened if it already
exists, with the <a href="../functions/shm_open.html"><i>shm_open</i>()</a> function. If the shared memory object is created, it
has a length of zero. The <a href="../functions/ftruncate.html"><i>ftruncate</i>()</a> function can be used to set the size of the
shared memory object after creation. The <a href="../functions/shm_unlink.html"><i>shm_unlink</i>()</a> function removes the name
for a shared memory object created by <a href="../functions/shm_open.html"><i>shm_open</i>()</a>.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Shared Memory Overview
<p class="tent">The shared memory facility defined by POSIX.1-2024 usually results in memory locations being added to the address
space of the process. The implementation returns the address of the new space to the application by means of a pointer. This works
well in languages like C. However, in languages without pointer types it will not work. In the bindings for such a language, either
a special COMMON section will need to be defined (which is unlikely), or the binding will have to allow existing structures to be
mapped. The implementation will likely have to place restrictions on the size and alignment of such structures or will have to map
a suitable region of the address space of the process into the memory object, and thus into other processes. These are issues for
that particular language binding. For POSIX.1-2024, however, the practice will not be forbidden, merely undefined.</p>
<p class="tent">Two potentially different name spaces are used for naming objects that may be mapped into process address spaces.
When using memory mapped files, files may be accessed via <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>. When the Shared
Memory Objects option is supported, sharable memory objects that might not be files may be accessed via the <a href=
"../functions/shm_open.html"><i>shm_open</i>()</a> function. These operations are not mutually-exclusive.</p>
<p class="tent">Some implementations supporting the Shared Memory Objects option may choose to implement the shared memory object
name space as part of the file system name space. There are several reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">It allows applications to prevent name conflicts by use of the directory structure.</li>
<li class="tent">It uses an existing mechanism for accessing global objects and prevents the creation of a new mechanism for naming
global objects.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">In such implementations, memory objects can be implemented using regular files, if that is what the implementation
chooses. The <a href="../functions/shm_open.html"><i>shm_open</i>()</a> function can be implemented as an <a href=
"../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> call in a fixed directory with the O_CLOEXEC flag set. The <a href=
"../functions/shm_unlink.html"><i>shm_unlink</i>()</a> function can be implemented as an <a href=
"../functions/unlink.html"><i>unlink</i>()</a> call.</p>
<p class="tent">On the other hand, it is also expected that small embedded systems that support the Shared Memory Objects option
may wish to implement shared memory without having any file systems present. In this case, the implementations may choose to use a
simple string valued name space for shared memory regions. The <a href="../functions/shm_open.html"><i>shm_open</i>()</a> function
permits either type of implementation.</p>
<p class="tent">Some implementations have hardware that supports protection of mapped data from certain classes of access and some
do not. Systems that supply this functionality support the memory protection functionality.</p>
<p class="tent">Some implementations restrict size, alignment, and protections to be on <i>page</i>-size boundaries. If an
implementation has no restrictions on size or alignment, it may specify a 1-byte page size. Applications on implementations that do
support larger pages must be cognizant of the page size since this is the alignment and protection boundary.</p>
<p class="tent">Simple embedded implementations may have a 1-byte page size and only support the Shared Memory Objects option. This
provides simple shared memory between processes without requiring mapping hardware.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1-2024 specifically allows a memory object to remain referenced after a close because that is existing
practice for the <a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_15" id="tag_22_02_08_15"></a>Typed Memory Functions</h5>
<p class="tent">Implementations may support the Typed Memory Objects option without supporting either the Shared Memory option or
memory mapped files. Types memory objects are pools of specialized storage, different from the main memory resource normally used
by a processor to hold code and data, that can be mapped into the address space of one or more processes.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Model
<p class="tent">Realtime systems conforming to one of the POSIX.13 realtime profiles are expected (and desired) to be supported on
systems with more than one type or pool of memory (for example, SRAM, DRAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM), where each type or pool of memory
may be accessible by one or more processors via one or more buses (ports). Memory mapped files, shared memory objects, and the
language-specific storage allocation operators (<a href="../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> for the ISO&nbsp;C standard,
<i>new</i> for ISO Ada) fail to provide application program interfaces versatile enough to allow applications to control their
utilization of such diverse memory resources. The typed memory interfaces <a href=
"../functions/posix_typed_mem_open.html"><i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/posix_mem_offset.html"><i>posix_mem_offset</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/posix_typed_mem_get_info.html"><i>posix_typed_mem_get_info</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a> defined herein support the
model of typed memory described below.</p>
<p class="tent">For purposes of this model, a system comprises several processors (for example, P<sub><small>1</small></sub> and
P<sub><small>2</small></sub>), several physical memory pools (for example, M<sub><small>1</small></sub>,
M<sub><small>2</small></sub>, M<sub><small>2a</small></sub>, M<sub><small>2b</small></sub>, M<sub><small>3</small></sub>,
M<sub><small>4</small></sub>, and M<sub><small>5</small></sub>), and several buses or &quot;ports&quot; (for example,
B<sub><small>1</small></sub>, B<sub><small>2</small></sub>, B<sub><small>3</small></sub>, and B<sub><small>4</small></sub>)
interconnecting the various processors and memory pools in some system-specific way. Notice that some memory pools may be contained
in others (for example, M<sub><small>2a</small></sub> and M<sub><small>2b</small></sub> are contained in
M<sub><small>2</small></sub>).</p>
<p class="tent"><a href="#tagfcjh_2">Example of a System with Typed Memory</a> shows an example of such a model. In a system like
this, an application should be able to perform the following operations: <img src=".././Figures/b-1.gif"></p>
<p class="caption"><a name="tagfcjh_2" id="tagfcjh_2"></a> Figure: Example of a System with Typed Memory</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Typed Memory Allocation
<p class="tent">An application should be able to allocate memory dynamically from the desired pool using the desired bus, and map
it into the address space of a process. For example, processor P<sub><small>1</small></sub> can allocate some portion of memory
pool M<sub><small>1</small></sub> through port B<sub><small>1</small></sub>, treating all unmapped subareas of
M<sub><small>1</small></sub> as a heap-storage resource from which memory may be allocated. This portion of memory is mapped into
address space of the process, and subsequently deallocated when unmapped from all processes.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Using the Same Storage Region from Different Buses
<p class="tent">An application process with a mapped region of storage that is accessed from one bus should be able to map that
same storage area at another address (subject to page size restrictions detailed in <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a>), to allow it to be accessed from another bus. For example, processor
P<sub><small>1</small></sub> may wish to access the same region of memory pool M<sub><small>2b</small></sub> both through ports
B<sub><small>1</small></sub> and B<sub><small>2</small></sub>.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Sharing Typed Memory Regions
<p class="tent">Several application processes running on the same or different processors may wish to share a particular region of
a typed memory pool. Each process or processor may wish to access this region through different buses. For example, processor
P<sub><small>1</small></sub> may want to share a region of memory pool M<sub><small>4</small></sub> with processor
P<sub><small>2</small></sub>, and they may be required to use buses B<sub><small>2</small></sub> and B<sub><small>3</small></sub>,
respectively, to minimize bus contention. A problem arises here when a process allocates and maps a portion of fragmented memory
and then wants to share this region of memory with another process, either in the same processor or different processors. The
solution adopted is to allow the first process to find out the memory map (offsets and lengths) of all the different fragments of
memory that were mapped into its address space, by repeatedly calling <a href=
"../functions/posix_mem_offset.html"><i>posix_mem_offset</i>()</a>. Then, this process can pass the offsets and lengths obtained to
the second process, which can then map the same memory fragments into its address space.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Contiguous Allocation
<p class="tent">The problem of finding the memory map of the different fragments of the memory pool that were mapped into logically
contiguous addresses of a given process can be solved by requesting contiguous allocation. For example, a process in
P<sub><small>1</small></sub> can allocate 10 Kbytes of physically contiguous memory from
M<sub><small>3</small></sub>-B<sub><small>1</small></sub>, and obtain the offset (within pool M<sub><small>3</small></sub>) of this
block of memory. Then, it can pass this offset (and the length) to a process in P<sub><small>2</small></sub> using some
interprocess communication mechanism. The second process can map the same block of memory by using the offset transferred and
specifying M<sub><small>3</small></sub>-B<sub><small>2</small></sub>.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Unallocated Mapping
<p class="tent">Any subarea of a memory pool that is mapped to a process, either as the result of an allocation request or an
explicit mapping, is normally unavailable for allocation. Special processes such as debuggers, however, may need to map large areas
of a typed memory pool, yet leave those areas available for allocation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">Typed memory allocation and mapping has to coexist with storage allocation operators like <a href=
"../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a>, but systems are free to choose how to implement this coexistence. For example, it
may be system configuration-dependent if all available system memory is made part of one of the typed memory pools or if some part
will be restricted to conventional allocation operators. Equally system configuration-dependent may be the availability of
operators like <a href="../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> to allocate storage from certain typed memory pools. It is
not excluded to configure a system such that a given named pool, P<sub><small>1</small></sub>, is in turn split into
non-overlapping named subpools. For example, M<sub><small>1</small></sub>-B<sub><small>1</small></sub>,
M<sub><small>2</small></sub>-B<sub><small>1</small></sub>, and M<sub><small>3</small></sub>-B<sub><small>1</small></sub> could also
be accessed as one common pool M<sub><small>123</small></sub>-B<sub><small>1</small></sub>. A call to <a href=
"../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> on P<sub><small>1</small></sub> could work on such a larger pool while full
optimization of memory usage by P<sub><small>1</small></sub> would require typed memory allocation at the subpool level.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Existing Practice
<p class="tent">OS-9 provides for the naming (numbering) and prioritization of memory types by a system administrator. It then
provides APIs to request memory allocation of typed (colored) memory by number, and to generate a bus address from a mapped memory
address (translate). When requesting colored memory, the user can specify type 0 to signify allocation from the first available
type in priority order.</p>
<p class="tent">HP-RT presents interfaces to map different kinds of storage regions that are visible through a VME bus, although it
does not provide allocation operations. It also provides functions to perform address translation between VME addresses and virtual
addresses. It represents a VME-bus unique solution to the general problem.</p>
<p class="tent">The PSOS approach is similar (that is, based on a pre-established mapping of bus address ranges to specific
memories) with a concept of segments and regions (regions dynamically allocated from a heap which is a special segment). Therefore,
PSOS does not fully address the general allocation problem either. PSOS does not have a &quot;process&quot;-based model, but more of a
&quot;thread&quot;-only-based model of multi-tasking. So mapping to a process address space is not an issue.</p>
<p class="tent">QNX uses the System&nbsp;V approach of opening specially named devices (shared memory segments) and using <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> to then gain access from the process. They do not address allocation directly, but once
typed shared memory can be mapped, an &quot;allocation manager&quot; process could be written to handle requests for allocation.</p>
<p class="tent">The System&nbsp;V approach also included allocation, implemented by opening yet other special &quot;devices&quot; which
allocate, rather than appearing as a whole memory object.</p>
<p class="tent">The Orkid realtime kernel interface definition has operations to manage memory &quot;regions&quot; and &quot;pools&quot;, which are
areas of memory that may reflect the differing physical nature of the memory. Operations to allocate memory from these regions and
pools are also provided.<br></p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Requirements
<p class="tent">Existing practice in SVID-derived UNIX systems relies on functionality similar to <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> and its related interfaces to achieve mapping and allocation of typed memory. However,
the issue of sharing typed memory (allocated or mapped) and the complication of multiple ports are not addressed in any consistent
way by existing UNIX system practice. Part of this functionality is existing practice in specialized realtime operating systems. In
order to solidify the capabilities implied by the model above, the following requirements are imposed on the interface:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Identification of Typed Memory Pools and Ports
<p class="tent">All processes (running in all processors) in the system are able to identify a particular (system configured) typed
memory pool accessed through a particular (system configured) port by a name. That name is a member of a name space common to all
these processes, but need not be the same name space as that containing ordinary pathnames. The association between memory
pools/ports and corresponding names is typically established when the system is configured. The &quot;open&quot; operation for typed memory
objects should be distinct from the <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> function, for consistency with other similar
services, but implementable on top of <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>. This implies that the handle for a typed
memory object will be a file descriptor.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Allocation and Mapping of Typed Memory
<p class="tent">Once a typed memory object has been identified by a process, it is possible to both map user-selected subareas of
that object into process address space and to map system-selected (that is, dynamically allocated) subareas of that object, with
user-specified length, into process address space. It is also possible to determine the maximum length of memory allocation that
may be requested from a given typed memory object.<br></p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Sharing Typed Memory
<p class="tent">Two or more processes are able to share portions of typed memory, either user-selected or dynamically allocated.
This requirement applies also to dynamically allocated regions of memory that are composed of several non-contiguous pieces.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Contiguous Allocation
<p class="tent">For dynamic allocation, it is the user's option whether the system is required to allocate a contiguous subarea
within the typed memory object, or whether it is permitted to allocate discontiguous fragments which appear contiguous in the
process mapping. Contiguous allocation simplifies the process of sharing allocated typed memory, while discontiguous allocation
allows for potentially better recovery of deallocated typed memory.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Accessing Typed Memory Through Different Ports
<p class="tent">Once a subarea of a typed memory object has been mapped, it is possible to determine the location and length
corresponding to a user-selected portion of that object within the memory pool. This location and length can then be used to remap
that portion of memory for access from another port. If the referenced portion of typed memory was allocated discontiguously, the
length thus determined may be shorter than anticipated, and the user code must adapt to the value returned.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Deallocation
<p class="tent">When a previously mapped subarea of typed memory is no longer mapped by any process in the systemâas a result of a
call or calls to <a href="../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a>â that subarea becomes potentially reusable for dynamic
allocation; actual reuse of the subarea is a function of the dynamic typed memory allocation policy.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Unallocated Mapping
<p class="tent">It must be possible to map user-selected subareas of a typed memory object without marking that subarea as
unavailable for allocation. This option is not the default behavior, and requires appropriate privileges.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="tent">Scenario
<p class="tent">The following scenario will serve to clarify the use of the typed memory interfaces.</p>
<p class="tent">Process A running on P<sub><small>1</small></sub> (see <a href="#tagfcjh_2">Example of a System with Typed
Memory</a>) wants to allocate some memory from memory pool M<sub><small>2</small></sub>, and it wants to share this portion of
memory with process B running on P<sub><small>2</small></sub>. Since P<sub><small>2</small></sub> only has access to the lower part
of M<sub><small>2</small></sub>, both processes will use the memory pool named M<sub><small>2b</small></sub> which is the part of
M<sub><small>2</small></sub> that is accessible both from P<sub><small>1</small></sub> and P<sub><small>2</small></sub>. The
operations that both processes need to perform are shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Allocating Typed Memory
<p class="tent">Process A calls <a href="../functions/posix_typed_mem_open.html"><i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>()</a> with the name
<b>/typed.m2b-b1</b> and a <i>tflag</i> of POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE to get a file descriptor usable for allocating from pool
M<sub><small>2b</small></sub> accessed through port B<sub><small>1</small></sub>. It then calls <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> with this file descriptor requesting a length of 4096 bytes. The system allocates two
discontiguous blocks of sizes 1024 and 3072 bytes within M<sub><small>2b</small></sub>. The <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> function returns a pointer to a 4096-byte array in process A's logical address space,
mapping the allocated blocks contiguously. Process A can then utilize the array, and store data in it.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Determining the Location of the Allocated Blocks
<p class="tent">Process A can determine the lengths and offsets (relative to M<sub><small>2b</small></sub>) of the two blocks
allocated, by using the following procedure: First, process A calls <a href=
"../functions/posix_mem_offset.html"><i>posix_mem_offset</i>()</a> with the address of the first element of the array and length
4096. Upon return, the offset and length (1024 bytes) of the first block are returned. A second call to <a href=
"../functions/posix_mem_offset.html"><i>posix_mem_offset</i>()</a> is then made using the address of the first element of the array
plus 1024 (the length of the first block), and a new length of 4096-1024. If there were more fragments allocated, this procedure
could have been continued within a loop until the offsets and lengths of all the blocks were obtained. Notice that this relatively
complex procedure can be avoided if contiguous allocation is requested (by opening the typed memory object with the <i>tflag</i>
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG).</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Sharing Data Across Processes
<p class="tent">Process A passes the two offset values and lengths obtained from the <a href=
"../functions/posix_mem_offset.html"><i>posix_mem_offset</i>()</a> calls to process B running on P<sub><small>2</small></sub>, via
some form of interprocess communication. Process B can gain access to process A's data by calling <a href=
"../functions/posix_typed_mem_open.html"><i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>()</a> with the name <b>/typed.m2b-b2</b> and a <i>tflag</i> of
zero, then using two <a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> calls on the resulting file descriptor to map the two
subareas of that typed memory object to its own address space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="tent">Rationale for no <i>mem_alloc</i>() and <i>mem_free</i>()
<p class="tent">The standard developers had originally proposed a pair of new flags to <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> which, when applied to a typed memory object descriptor, would cause <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> to allocate dynamically from an unallocated and unmapped area of the typed memory
object. Deallocation was similarly accomplished through the use of <a href="../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a>. This was
rejected by the ballot group because it excessively complicated the (already rather complex) <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> interface and introduced semantics useful only for typed memory, to a function which
must also map shared memory and files. They felt that a memory allocator should be built on top of <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> instead of being incorporated within the same interface, much as the ISO&nbsp;C standard
libraries build <a href="../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> on top of the virtual memory mapping functions <i>brk</i>()
and <i>sbrk</i>(). This would eliminate the complicated semantics involved with unmapping only part of an allocated block of typed
memory.</p>
<p class="tent">To attempt to achieve ballot group consensus, typed memory allocation and deallocation was first migrated from
<a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a> to a pair of
complementary functions modeled on the ISO&nbsp;C standard <a href="../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/free.html"><i>free</i>()</a>. The <i>mem_alloc</i>() function specified explicitly the typed memory object (typed
memory pool/access port) from which allocation takes place, unlike <a href="../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> where the
memory pool and port are unspecified. The <i>mem_free</i>() function handled deallocation. These new semantics still met all of the
requirements detailed above without modifying the behavior of <a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> except to allow it
to map specified areas of typed memory objects. An implementation would have been free to implement <i>mem_alloc</i>() and
<i>mem_free</i>() over <a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a>, through <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a>, or independently but cooperating with <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">The ballot group was queried to see if this was an acceptable alternative, and while there was some agreement that
it achieved the goal of removing the complicated semantics of allocation from the <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> interface, several balloters realized that it just created two additional functions that
behaved, in great part, like <a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a>. These balloters proposed an alternative which has
been implemented here in place of a separate <i>mem_alloc</i>() and <i>mem_free</i>(). This alternative is based on four specific
suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">The <a href="../functions/posix_typed_mem_open.html"><i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>()</a> function should provide a
flag which specifies &quot;allocate on <a href="../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a>&quot; (otherwise, <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> just maps the underlying object). This allows things roughly similar to <b>/dev/zero</b>
<i>versus</i> <b>/dev/swap</b>. Two such flags have been implemented, one of which forces contiguous allocation.</li>
<li class="tent">The <a href="../functions/posix_mem_offset.html"><i>posix_mem_offset</i>()</a> function is acceptable because it
can be applied usefully to mapped objects in general. It should return the file descriptor of the underlying object.</li>
<li class="tent">The <i>mem_get_info</i>() function in an earlier draft should be renamed <a href=
"../functions/posix_typed_mem_get_info.html"><i>posix_typed_mem_get_info</i>()</a> because it is not generally applicable to memory
objects. It should probably return the file descriptor's allocation attribute. The renaming of the function has been implemented,
but having it return a piece of information which is readily known by an application without this function has been rejected. Its
whole purpose is to query the typed memory object for attributes that are not user-specified, but determined by the
implementation.</li>
<li class="tent">There should be no separate <i>mem_alloc</i>() or <i>mem_free</i>() functions. Instead, using <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a> on a typed memory object opened with an &quot;allocate on <a href=
"../functions/mmap.html"><i>mmap</i>()</a>&quot; flag should be used to force allocation. These are precisely the semantics defined in
the current draft.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="tent">Rationale for no Typed Memory Access Management
<p class="tent">The working group had originally defined an additional interface (and an additional kind of object: typed memory
manager) to establish and dissolve mappings to typed memory on behalf of devices or processors which were independent of the
operating system and had no inherent capability to directly establish mappings on their own. This was to have provided
functionality similar to device driver interfaces such as <i>physio</i>() and their underlying bus-specific interfaces (for
example, <i>mballoc</i>()) which serve to set up and break down DMA pathways, and derive mapped addresses for use by hardware
devices and processor cards.</p>
<p class="tent">The ballot group felt that this was beyond the scope of POSIX.1 and its amendments. Furthermore, the removal of
interrupt handling interfaces from a preceding amendment (the IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1d-1999) during its balloting process renders
these typed memory access management interfaces an incomplete solution to portable device management from a user process; it would
be possible to initiate a device transfer to/from typed memory, but impossible to handle the transfer-complete interrupt in a
portable way.</p>
<p class="tent">To achieve ballot group consensus, all references to typed memory access management capabilities were removed. The
concept of portable interfaces from a device driver to both operating system and hardware is being addressed by the Uniform Driver
Interface (UDI) industry forum, with formal standardization deferred until proof of concept and industry-wide acceptance and
implementation.</p>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_08_16" id="tag_22_02_08_16"></a>B.2.8.4 Process Scheduling</h5>
<p class="tent">IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.1 #96 has been applied, adding the <a href=
"../functions/pthread_setschedprio.html"><i>pthread_setschedprio</i>()</a> function. This was added since previously there was no
way for a thread to lower its own priority without going to the tail of the threads list for its new priority. This capability is
necessary to bound the duration of priority inversion encountered by a thread.</p>
<p class="tent">The following portion of the rationale presents models, requirements, and standardization issues relevant to
process and thread scheduling; see <a href="#tag_22_02_09_12">B.2.9.4 Thread Scheduling</a> for additional rationale relevant to
thread scheduling.</p>
<p class="tent">In an operating system supporting multiple concurrent processes or threads, the system determines the order in
which processes or threads execute to meet implementation-defined goals. For time-sharing systems, the goal is to enhance system
throughput and promote fairness; the application is provided with little or no control over this sequencing function. While this is
acceptable and desirable behavior in a time-sharing system, it is inappropriate in a realtime system; realtime applications must
specifically control the execution sequence of their concurrent processes or threads in order to meet externally defined response
requirements.</p>
<p class="tent">In POSIX.1-2024, the control over process and thread sequencing is provided using a concept of scheduling policies.
These policies, described in detail in this section, define the behavior of the system whenever processor resources are to be
allocated to competing processes or threads. Only the behavior of the policy is defined; conforming implementations are free to use
any mechanism desired to achieve the described behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Models
<p class="tent">In an operating system supporting multiple concurrent processes or threads, the system determines the order in
which threads (including those that are the only thread in a single-threaded process) execute and might force long-running threads
to yield to other threads at certain intervals. Typically, the scheduling code is executed whenever an event occurs that might
alter the thread to be executed next.</p>
<p class="tent">The simplest scheduling strategy is a &quot;first-in, first-out&quot; (FIFO) dispatcher. Whenever a thread becomes
runnable, it is placed on the end of a ready list. When processing resources become available, the thread at the front of the ready
list starts or resumes execution and is removed from the list. This thread is executed until it exits or becomes blocked, at which
point the processing resources used to execute it become available to execute another runnable thread. This scheduling technique is
also known as &quot;run-to-completion&quot; or &quot;run-to-block&quot;.</p>
<p class="tent">A natural extension to this scheduling technique is the assignment of a &quot;non-migrating priority&quot; to each thread.
This policy differs from strict FIFO scheduling in only one respect: whenever a thread becomes runnable, it is placed at the end of
the list of threads runnable at that priority level. When selecting a thread to run, the system always selects the first thread
from the highest priority queue with a runnable thread. Thus, when a thread becomes unblocked, it will preempt a running thread of
lower priority without otherwise altering the ready list. Further, if a running or runnable thread's priority is altered, it is
removed from the ready list for its old priority (if present in the list; that is, not running) and is inserted into the ready list
for its new priority, according to the policy above, except that threads executing at a temporarily elevated priority as a
consequence of owning a mutex initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol are exempted from this in
order to ensure that a thread can lock and unlock such as mutex without the implicit yield that any resulting priority changes
would normally cause.</p>
<p class="tent">While the above policy might be considered unfriendly in a time-sharing environment in which multiple users require
more balanced resource allocation, it could be ideal in a realtime environment for several reasons. The most important of these is
that it is deterministic: the highest-priority thread is always run and, among threads of equal priority, the thread that has been
runnable for the longest time is executed first. Because of this determinism, cooperating threads can implement more complex
scheduling simply by altering their priority. For instance, if threads at a single priority were to reschedule themselves at fixed
time intervals, a time-slice policy would result.</p>
<p class="tent">In a dedicated operating system in which all threads belong to well-behaved realtime applications, non-migrating
priority scheduling is sufficient. However, many existing implementations provide for more complex scheduling policies.</p>
<p class="tent">For process scheduling, POSIX.1-2024 specifies a linear scheduling model. In this model, every process in the
system has a priority. The system scheduler always dispatches a process that has the highest (generally the most time-critical)
priority among all runnable processes in the system. As long as there is only one such process, the dispatching policy is trivial.
When multiple processes of equal priority are eligible to run, they are ordered according to a strict run-to-completion (FIFO)
policy. Thread scheduling is similar, except that the scheduling policy can be applied just to the threads within one process
(PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS scheduling contention scope) or to all threads system-wide (PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM scheduling contention
scope). This and other considerations specific to thread scheduling are the subject of <a href="#tag_22_02_09_12">B.2.9.4 Thread
Scheduling</a>; the remainder of this section is described in terms of process scheduling but is also relevant to thread
scheduling when read in conjunction with <a href="#tag_22_02_09_12">B.2.9.4 Thread Scheduling</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">The priority is represented as a positive integer and is inherited from the parent process. For processes running
under a fixed priority scheduling policy, the priority is never altered except by an explicit function call.</p>
<p class="tent">It was determined arbitrarily that larger integers correspond to &quot;higher priorities&quot;.</p>
<p class="tent">Certain implementations might impose restrictions on the priority ranges to which processes can be assigned. There
also can be restrictions on the set of policies to which processes can be set.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Requirements
<p class="tent">Realtime processes require that scheduling be fast and deterministic, and that it guarantees to preempt lower
priority processes.</p>
<p class="tent">Thus, given the linear scheduling model, realtime processes require that they be run at a priority that is higher
than other processes. Within this framework, realtime processes are free to yield execution resources to each other in a completely
portable and implementation-defined manner.</p>
<p class="tent">As there is a generally perceived requirement for processes at the same priority level to share processor resources
more equitably, provisions are made by providing a scheduling policy (that is, SCHED_RR) intended to provide a timeslice-like
facility. <basefont size="2"></p>

<li class="tent">Rationale for New Interface
<p class="tent">Realtime applications need to be able to determine when processes will run in relation to each other. It must be
possible to guarantee that a critical process will run whenever it is runnable; that is, whenever it wants to for as long as it
needs. SCHED_FIFO satisfies this requirement. Additionally, SCHED_RR was defined to meet a realtime requirement for a well-defined
time-sharing policy for processes at the same priority.</p>
<p class="tent">It would be possible to use the BSD <a href="../functions/setpriority.html"><i>setpriority</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/getpriority.html"><i>getpriority</i>()</a> functions by redefining the meaning of the &quot;nice&quot; parameter according to
the scheduling policy currently in use by the process. The System&nbsp;V <a href="../functions/nice.html"><i>nice</i>()</a>
interface was felt to be undesirable for realtime because it specifies an adjustment to the &quot;nice&quot; value, rather than setting it
to an explicit value. Realtime applications will usually want to set priority to an explicit value. Also, System&nbsp;V <a href=
"../functions/nice.html"><i>nice</i>()</a> does not allow for changing the priority of another process.</p>
<p class="tent">With the POSIX.1b interfaces, the traditional &quot;nice&quot; value does not affect the SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR scheduling
policies. If a &quot;nice&quot; value is supported, it is implementation-defined whether it affects the SCHED_OTHER policy.</p>
<p class="tent">An important aspect of POSIX.1-2024 is the explicit description of the queuing and preemption rules. It is
critical, to achieve deterministic scheduling, that such rules be stated clearly in POSIX.1-2024.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1-2024 does not address the interaction between priority and swapping. The issues involved with swapping and
virtual memory paging are extremely implementation-defined and would be nearly impossible to standardize at this point. The
proposed scheduling paradigm, however, fully describes the scheduling behavior of runnable processes, of which one criterion is
that the working set be resident in memory. Assuming the existence of a portable interface for locking portions of a process in
memory, paging behavior need not affect the scheduling of realtime processes.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1-2024 also does not address the priorities of &quot;system&quot; processes. In general, these processes should
always execute in low-priority ranges to avoid conflict with other realtime processes. Implementations should document the priority
ranges in which system processes run.</p>
<p class="tent">The default scheduling policy is not defined. The effect of I/O interrupts and other system processing activities
is not defined. The temporary lending of priority from one process to another (such as for the purposes of affecting freeing
resources) by the system is not addressed. Preemption of resources is not addressed. Restrictions on the ability of a process to
affect other processes beyond a certain level (influence levels) is not addressed.</p>
<p class="tent">The rationale used to justify the simple time-quantum scheduler is that it is common practice to depend upon this
type of scheduling to ensure &quot;fair&quot; distribution of processor resources among portions of the application that must interoperate
in a serial fashion. Note that POSIX.1-2024 is silent with respect to the setting of this time quantum, or whether it is a
system-wide value or a per-process value, although it appears that the prevailing realtime practice is for it to be a system-wide
value.</p>
<p class="tent">In a system with <i>N</i> processes at a given priority, all processor-bound, in which the time quantum is equal
for all processes at a specific priority level, the following assumptions are made of such a scheduling policy:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">A time quantum <i>Q</i> exists and the current process will own control of the processor for at least a duration
of <i>Q</i> and will have the processor for a duration of <i>Q</i>.</li>
<li class="tent">The <i>N</i>th process at that priority will control a processor within a duration of (<i>N</i>-1) Ã
<i>Q</i>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">These assumptions are necessary to provide equal access to the processor and bounded response from the
application.</p>
<p class="tent">The assumptions hold for the described scheduling policy only if no system overhead, such as interrupt servicing,
is present. If the interrupt servicing load is non-zero, then one of the two assumptions becomes fallacious, based upon how
<i>Q</i> is measured by the system.</p>
<p class="tent">If <i>Q</i> is measured by clock time, then the assumption that the process obtains a duration <i>Q</i> processor
time is false if interrupt overhead exists. Indeed, a scenario can be constructed with <i>N</i> processes in which a single process
undergoes complete processor starvation if a peripheral device, such as an analog-to-digital converter, generates significant
interrupt activity periodically with a period of <i>N</i> Ã <i>Q</i>.</p>
<p class="tent">If <i>Q</i> is measured as actual processor time, then the assumption that the <i>N</i>th process runs in within
the duration (<i>N</i>-1) Ã <i>Q</i> is false.</p>
<p class="tent">It should be noted that SCHED_FIFO suffers from interrupt-based delay as well. However, for SCHED_FIFO, the implied
response of the system is &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, so that the interrupt load for this case is a vendor selection and not a
compliance issue.</p>
<p class="tent">With this in mind, it is necessary either to complete the definition by including bounds on the interrupt load, or
to modify the assumptions that can be made about the scheduling policy.</p>
<p class="tent">Since the motivation of inclusion of the policy is common usage, and since current applications do not enjoy the
luxury of bounded interrupt load, item (2) above is sufficient to express existing application needs and is less restrictive in the
standard definition. No difference in interface is necessary.</p>
<p class="tent">In an implementation in which the time quantum is equal for all processes at a specific priority, our assumptions
can then be restated as:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">A time quantum <i>Q</i> exists, and a processor-bound process will be rescheduled after a duration of, at most,
<i>Q</i>. Time quantum <i>Q</i> may be defined in either wall clock time or execution time.</li>
<li class="tent">In general, the <i>N</i>th process of a priority level should wait no longer than (<i>N</i>-1) Ã <i>Q</i> time to
execute, assuming no processes exist at higher priority levels.</li>
<li class="tent">No process should wait indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">For implementations supporting per-process time quanta, these assumptions can be readily extended.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_17" id="tag_22_02_08_17"></a>Sporadic Server Scheduling Policy</h5>
<p class="tent">The sporadic server is a mechanism defined for scheduling aperiodic activities in time-critical realtime systems.
This mechanism reserves a certain bounded amount of execution capacity for processing aperiodic events at a high priority level.
Any aperiodic events that cannot be processed within the bounded amount of execution capacity are executed in the background at a
low priority level. Thus, a certain amount of execution capacity can be guaranteed to be available for processing periodic tasks,
even under burst conditions in the arrival of aperiodic processing requests (that is, a large number of requests in a short time
interval). The sporadic server also simplifies the schedulability analysis of the realtime system, because it allows aperiodic
processes or threads to be treated as if they were periodic. The sporadic server was first described by Sprunt, et al.</p>
<p class="tent">The key concept of the sporadic server is to provide and limit a certain amount of computation capacity for
processing aperiodic events at their assigned normal priority, during a time interval called the &quot;replenishment period&quot;. Once the
entity controlled by the sporadic server mechanism is initialized with its period and execution-time budget attributes, it
preserves its execution capacity until an aperiodic request arrives. The request will be serviced (if there are no higher priority
activities pending) as long as there is execution capacity left. If the request is completed, the actual execution time used to
service it is subtracted from the capacity, and a replenishment of this amount of execution time is scheduled to happen one
replenishment period after the arrival of the aperiodic request. If the request is not completed, because there is no execution
capacity left, then the aperiodic process or thread is assigned a lower background priority. For each portion of consumed execution
capacity the execution time used is replenished after one replenishment period. At the time of replenishment, if the sporadic
server was executing at a background priority level, its priority is elevated to the normal level. Other similar replenishment
policies have been defined, but the one presented here represents a compromise between efficiency and implementation
complexity.</p>
<p class="tent">The interface that appears in this section defines a new scheduling policy for threads and processes that behaves
according to the rules of the sporadic server mechanism. Scheduling attributes are defined and functions are provided to allow the
user to set and get the parameters that control the scheduling behavior of this mechanism, namely the normal and low priority, the
replenishment period, the maximum number of pending replenishment operations, and the initial execution-time budget.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Scheduling Aperiodic Activities
<p class="tent">Virtually all realtime applications are required to process aperiodic activities. In many cases, there are tight
timing constraints that the response to the aperiodic events must meet. Usual timing requirements imposed on the response to these
events are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">The effects of an aperiodic activity on the response time of lower priority activities must be controllable and
predictable.</li>
<li class="tent">The system must provide the fastest possible response time to aperiodic events.</li>
<li class="tent">It must be possible to take advantage of all the available processing bandwidth not needed by time-critical
activities to enhance average-case response times to aperiodic events.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">Traditional methods for scheduling aperiodic activities are background processing, polling tasks, and direct event
execution:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Background processing consists of assigning a very low priority to the processing of aperiodic events. It utilizes
all the available bandwidth in the system that has not been consumed by higher priority threads. However, it is very difficult, or
impossible, to meet requirements on average-case response time, because the aperiodic entity has to wait for the execution of all
other entities which have higher priority.</li>
<li class="tent">Polling consists of creating a periodic process or thread for servicing aperiodic requests. At regular intervals,
the polling entity is started and its services accumulated pending aperiodic requests. If no aperiodic requests are pending, the
polling entity suspends itself until its next period. Polling allows the aperiodic requests to be processed at a higher priority
level. However, worst and average-case response times of polling entities are a direct function of the polling period, and there is
execution overhead for each polling period, even if no event has arrived. If the deadline of the aperiodic activity is short
compared to the inter-arrival time, the polling frequency must be increased to guarantee meeting the deadline. For this case, the
increase in frequency can dramatically reduce the efficiency of the system and, therefore, its capacity to meet all deadlines. Yet,
polling represents a good way to handle a large class of practical problems because it preserves system predictability, and because
the amortized overhead drops as load increases.</li>
<li class="tent">Direct event execution consists of executing the aperiodic events at a high fixed-priority level. Typically, the
aperiodic event is processed by an interrupt service routine as soon as it arrives. This technique provides predictable response
times for aperiodic events, but makes the response times of all lower priority activities completely unpredictable under burst
arrival conditions. Therefore, if the density of aperiodic event arrivals is unbounded, it may be a dangerous technique for
time-critical systems. Yet, for those cases in which the physics of the system imposes a bound on the event arrival rate, it is
probably the most efficient technique.</li>
<li class="tent">The sporadic server scheduling algorithm combines the predictability of the polling approach with the short
response times of the direct event execution. Thus, it allows systems to meet an important class of application requirements that
cannot be met by using the traditional approaches. Multiple sporadic servers with different attributes can be applied to the
scheduling of multiple classes of aperiodic events, each with different kinds of timing requirements, such as individual deadlines,
average response times, and so on. It also has many other interesting applications for realtime, such as scheduling
producer/consumer tasks in time-critical systems, limiting the effects of faults on the estimation of task execution-time
requirements, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="tent">Existing Practice
<p class="tent">The sporadic server has been used in different kinds of applications, including military avionics, robot control
systems, industrial automation systems, and so on. There are examples of many systems that cannot be successfully scheduled using
the classic approaches, such as direct event execution, or polling, and are schedulable using a sporadic server scheduler. The
sporadic server algorithm itself can successfully schedule all systems scheduled with direct event execution or polling.</p>
<p class="tent">The sporadic server scheduling policy has been implemented as a commercial product in the run-time system of the
Verdix Ada compiler. There are also many applications that have used a much less efficient application-level sporadic server. These
realtime applications would benefit from a sporadic server scheduler implemented at the scheduler level.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Library-Level <i>versus</i> Kernel-Level Implementation
<p class="tent">The sporadic server interface described in this section requires the sporadic server policy to be implemented at
the same level as the scheduler. This means that the process sporadic server must be implemented at the kernel level and the thread
sporadic server policy implemented at the same level as the thread scheduler; that is, kernel or library level.</p>
<p class="tent">In an earlier interface for the sporadic server, this mechanism was implementable at a different level than the
scheduler. This feature allowed the implementor to choose between an efficient scheduler-level implementation, or a simpler user or
library-level implementation. However, the working group considered that this interface made the use of sporadic servers more
complex, and that library-level implementations would lack some of the important functionality of the sporadic server, namely the
limitation of the actual execution time of aperiodic activities. The working group also felt that the interface described in this
chapter does not preclude library-level implementations of threads intended to provide efficient low-overhead scheduling for those
threads that are not scheduled under the sporadic server policy.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Range of Scheduling Priorities
<p class="tent">Each of the scheduling policies supported in POSIX.1-2024 has an associated range of priorities. The priority
ranges for each policy might or might not overlap with the priority ranges of other policies. For time-critical realtime
applications it is usual for periodic and aperiodic activities to be scheduled together in the same processor. Periodic activities
will usually be scheduled using the SCHED_FIFO scheduling policy, while aperiodic activities may be scheduled using SCHED_SPORADIC.
Since the application developer will require complete control over the relative priorities of these activities in order to meet his
timing requirements, it would be desirable for the priority ranges of SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_SPORADIC to overlap completely.
Therefore, although POSIX.1-2024 does not require any particular relationship between the different priority ranges, it is
recommended that these two ranges should coincide.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Dynamically Setting the Sporadic Server Policy
<p class="tent">Several members of the working group requested that implementations should not be required to support dynamically
setting the sporadic server scheduling policy for a thread. The reason is that this policy may have a high overhead for
library-level implementations of threads, and if threads are allowed to dynamically set this policy, this overhead can be
experienced even if the thread does not use that policy. By disallowing the dynamic setting of the sporadic server scheduling
policy, these implementations can accomplish efficient scheduling for threads using other policies. If a strictly conforming
application needs to use the sporadic server policy, and is therefore willing to pay the overhead, it must set this policy at the
time of thread creation.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Limitation of the Number of Pending Replenishments
<p class="tent">The number of simultaneously pending replenishment operations must be limited for each sporadic server for two
reasons: an unlimited number of replenishment operations would need an unlimited number of system resources to store all the
pending replenishment operations; on the other hand, in some implementations each replenishment operation will represent a source
of priority inversion (just for the duration of the replenishment operation) and thus, the maximum amount of replenishments must be
bounded to guarantee bounded response times. The way in which the number of replenishments is bounded is by lowering the priority
of the sporadic server to <i>sched_ss_low_priority</i> when the number of pending replenishments has reached its limit. In this
way, no new replenishments are scheduled until the number of pending replenishments decreases.</p>
<p class="tent">In the sporadic server scheduling policy defined in POSIX.1-2024, the application can specify the maximum number of
pending replenishment operations for a single sporadic server, by setting the value of the <i>sched_ss_max_repl</i> scheduling
parameter. This value must be between one and {SS_REPL_MAX}, which is a maximum limit imposed by the implementation. The limit
{SS_REPL_MAX} must be greater than or equal to {_POSIX_SS_REPL_MAX}, which is defined to be four in POSIX.1-2024. The minimum limit
of four was chosen so that an application can at least guarantee that four different aperiodic events can be processed during each
interval of length equal to the replenishment period.</p>

<li class="tent">Clocks
<p class="tent">POSIX.1-2024 and the ISO&nbsp;C standard both define functions for obtaining system time. Implicit behind these
functions is a mechanism for measuring passage of time. This specification makes this mechanism explicit and calls it a clock. The
CLOCK_REALTIME clock required by POSIX.1-2024 is a higher resolution version of the clock that maintains POSIX.1 system time. This
is a &quot;system-wide&quot; clock, in that it is visible to all processes and, were it possible for multiple processes to all read the
clock at the same time, they would see the same value.</p>
<p class="tent">An extensible interface was defined, with the ability for implementations to define additional clocks. This was
done because of the observation that many realtime platforms support multiple clocks, and it was desired to fit this model within
the standard interface. But implementation-defined clocks need not represent actual hardware devices, nor are they necessarily
system-wide.</p>

and then is disarmed. With the specified facilities, this is accomplished by setting the <i>it_value</i> member of the <i>value</i>

</li>
<li class="tent">Periodic

repetition interval. When the initial expiration occurs, the timer is reloaded with the repetition interval and continues counting.

<p class="tent">[Time of Day]</p>
<p class="tent">To achieve this type of scheduling using the specified facilities, one would allocate a per-process timer based on
clock ID CLOCK_REALTIME. Then the timer would be armed via a call to <a href=
"../functions/timer_settime.html"><i>timer_settime</i>()</a> with TIMER_ABSTIME flag set, and with an initial expiration value
equal to 2:00 a.m. and a repetition interval equal to 15 minutes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="tent">Relationship of Timers to Clocks
<p class="tent">The relationship between clocks and timers armed with an absolute time is straightforward: a timer expiration
signal is requested when the associated clock reaches or exceeds the specified time. The relationship between clocks and timers
armed with a relative time (an interval) is less obvious, but not unintuitive. In this case, a timer expiration signal is requested
when the specified interval, <i>as measured by the associated clock</i>, has passed. For the required CLOCK_REALTIME clock, this
allows timer expiration signals to be requested at specified &quot;wall clock&quot; times (absolute), or when a specified interval of
&quot;realtime&quot; has passed (relative). For an implementation-defined clockâsay, a process virtual time clockâtimer expirations could
be requested when the process has used a specified total amount of virtual time (absolute), or when it has used a specified
<i>additional</i> amount of virtual time (relative).</p>
<p class="tent">The interfaces also allow flexibility in the implementation of the functions. For example, an implementation could
convert all absolute times to intervals by subtracting the clock value at the time of the call from the requested expiration time
and &quot;counting down&quot; at the supported resolution. Or it could convert all relative times to absolute expiration time by adding in
the clock value at the time of the call and comparing the clock value to the expiration time at the supported resolution. Or it
might even choose to maintain absolute times as absolute and compare them to the clock value at the supported resolution for
absolute timers, and maintain relative times as intervals and count them down at the resolution supported for relative timers. The
choice will be driven by efficiency considerations and the underlying hardware or software clock implementation.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Data Definitions for Clocks and Timers
<p class="tent">POSIX.1-2024 uses a time representation capable of supporting nanosecond resolution timers for the following
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">To enable POSIX.1-2024 to represent those computer systems already using nanosecond or submicrosecond resolution
clocks.</li>
<li class="tent">To accommodate those per-process timers that might need nanoseconds to specify an absolute value of system-wide
clocks, even though the resolution of the per-process timer may only be milliseconds, or <i>vice versa</i>.</li>
<li class="tent">Because the number of nanoseconds in a second can be represented in 32 bits.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">Time values are represented in the <b>timespec</b> structure. The <i>tv_sec</i> member is of type <b>time_t</b> so
that this member is compatible with time values used by POSIX.1 functions and the ISO&nbsp;C standard. The <i>tv_nsec</i> member is
a <b>signed long</b> in order to simplify and clarify code that decrements or finds differences of time values. Note that because 1
billion (number of nanoseconds per second) is less than half of the value representable by a signed 32-bit value, it is always
possible to add two valid fractional seconds represented as integral nanoseconds without overflowing the signed 32-bit value.</p>
<p class="tent">A maximum allowable resolution for the CLOCK_REALTIME clock of 20 ms (1/50 seconds) was chosen to allow line
frequency clocks in European countries to be conforming. 60 Hz clocks in the US will also be conforming, as will finer granularity
clocks, although a Strictly Conforming Application cannot assume a granularity of less than 20 ms (1/50 seconds).</p>
<p class="tent">The minimum allowable maximum time allowed for the CLOCK_REALTIME clock and the function <a href=
"../functions/nanosleep.html"><i>nanosleep</i>()</a>, and timers created with <i>clock_id</i>=CLOCK_REALTIME, is determined by the
fact that the <i>tv_sec</i> member is of type <b>time_t</b>.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1-2024 specifies that timer expirations must not be delivered early, and <a href=
"../functions/nanosleep.html"><i>nanosleep</i>()</a> must not return early due to quantization error. POSIX.1-2024 discusses the
various implementations of <a href="../functions/alarm.html"><i>alarm</i>()</a> in the rationale and states that implementations
that do not allow alarm signals to occur early are the most appropriate, but refrained from mandating this behavior. Because of the
importance of predictability to realtime applications, POSIX.1-2024 takes a stronger stance.</p>
<p class="tent">The standard developers considered using a time representation that differs from POSIX.1b in the second 32 bit of
the 64-bit value. Whereas POSIX.1b defines this field as a fractional second in nanoseconds, the other methodology defines this as
a binary fraction of one second, with the radix point assumed before the most significant bit.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX.1b is a software, source-level standard and most of the benefits of the alternate representation are enjoyed
by hardware implementations of clocks and algorithms. It was felt that mandating this format for POSIX.1b clocks and timers would
unnecessarily burden the application developer with writing, possibly non-portable, multiple precision arithmetic packages to
perform conversion between binary fractions and integral units such as nanoseconds, milliseconds, and so on.</p>

</ul>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_19" id="tag_22_02_08_19"></a>Rationale for the Monotonic Clock</h5>
<p class="tent">For those applications that use time services to achieve realtime behavior, changing the value of the clock on
which these services rely may cause erroneous timing behavior. For these applications, it is necessary to have a monotonic clock
which cannot run backwards, and which has a maximum clock jump that is required to be documented by the implementation.
Additionally, it is desirable (but not required by POSIX.1-2024) that the monotonic clock increases its value uniformly. This clock
should not be affected by changes to the system time; for example, to synchronize the clock with an external source or to account
for leap seconds. Such changes would cause errors in the measurement of time intervals for those time services that use the
absolute value of the clock.</p>
<p class="tent">One could argue that by defining the behavior of time services when the value of a clock is changed, deterministic
realtime behavior can be achieved. For example, one could specify that relative time services should be unaffected by changes in
the value of a clock. However, there are time services that are based upon an absolute time, but that are essentially intended as
relative time services. For example, <a href="../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> uses an
absolute time to allow it to wake up after the required interval despite spurious wakeups. Although sometimes the <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> timeouts are absolute in nature, there are many
occasions in which they are relative, and their absolute value is determined from the current time plus a relative time interval.
In this latter case, if the clock changes while the thread is waiting, the wait interval will not be the expected length. If a
<a href="../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> function were created that would take a
relative time, it would not solve the problem because to retain the intended &quot;deadline&quot; a thread would need to compensate for
latency due to the spurious wakeup, and preemption between wakeup and the next wait.</p>
<p class="tent">The solution is to create a new monotonic clock, whose value does not change except for the regular ticking of the
clock, and use this clock for implementing the various relative timeouts that appear in the different POSIX interfaces, as well as
allow <a href="../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> to choose this new clock for its
timeout. A new <a href="../functions/clock_nanosleep.html"><i>clock_nanosleep</i>()</a> function is created to allow an application
to take advantage of this newly defined clock. Notice that the monotonic clock may be implemented using the same hardware clock as
the system clock.</p>
<p class="tent">Relative timeouts for <a href="../functions/sigtimedwait.html"><i>sigtimedwait</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/aio_suspend.html"><i>aio_suspend</i>()</a> have been redefined to use the monotonic clock, if present. The <a href=
"../functions/alarm.html"><i>alarm</i>()</a> function has not been redefined, because the same effect but with better resolution
can be achieved by creating a timer (for which the appropriate clock may be chosen).</p>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> function has been
treated in a different way, compared to other functions with absolute timeouts, because it is used to wait for an event, and thus
it may have a deadline, while the other timeouts are generally used as an error recovery mechanism, and for them the use of the
monotonic clock is not so important. Since the desired timeout for the <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> function may either be a relative interval or an
absolute time of day deadline, a new initialization attribute has been created for condition variables to specify the clock that is
used for measuring the timeout in a call to <a href="../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a>.
In this way, if a relative timeout is desired, the monotonic clock will be used; if an absolute deadline is required instead, the
CLOCK_REALTIME or another appropriate clock may be used. For condition variables, this capability is also available by passing
CLOCK_MONOTONIC to the <a href="../functions/pthread_cond_clockwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_clockwait</i>()</a> function. Similarly,
CLOCK_MONOTONIC can be specified when calling <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutex_clocklock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_clocklock</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_clockrdlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_clockrdlock</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/sem_clockwait.html"><i>sem_clockwait</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">It was later found necessary to add variants of almost all interfaces that accept absolute timeouts that allow the
clock to be specified. This is because, despite the claim in the previous paragraph, it is not possible to safely use a
CLOCK_REALTIME absolute timeout even to prevent errors when the system clock is warped by a potentially large amount. A &quot;safety
timeout&quot; of a minute on a call to <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_timedlock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>()</a> could
actually mean that the call would return ETIMEDOUT early without acquiring the lock if the system clock is warped forwards
immediately prior to or during the call. On the other hand, a short timeout could end up being arbitrarily long if the system clock
is warped backwards immediately prior to or during the call. These problems are solved by the new <i>clockwait</i> and
<i>clocklock</i> variants of the existing <i>timedwait</i> and <i>timedlock</i> functions. These variants accept an extra
<b>clockid_t</b> parameter to indicate the clock to be used for the wait. The clock ID is passed rather than using attributes as
previously for <a href="../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> in order to allow the
ISO/IEC&nbsp;14882:2011 standard (C++11) and later to be implemented correctly. C++ requires that the clock to use for the wait is
not known until the time of the wait call, so it cannot be supplied during creation. The new functions are <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_clockwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_clockwait</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutex_clocklock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_clocklock</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_clockrdlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_clockrdlock</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/sem_clockwait.html"><i>sem_clockwait</i>()</a>. It is expected that <i>mq_clockreceive()</i> and
<i>mq_clocksend()</i> functions will be added in a future version of this standard.</p>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/nanosleep.html"><i>nanosleep</i>()</a> function has not been modified with the
introduction of the monotonic clock. Instead, a new <a href="../functions/clock_nanosleep.html"><i>clock_nanosleep</i>()</a>
function has been created, in which the desired clock may be specified in the function call.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">History of Resolution Issues
<p class="tent">Due to the shift from relative to absolute timeouts in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1d-1999, the amendments to the

that CLOCK_MONOTONIC would be used for the (relative) timeouts if the (optional at the time) Monotonic Clock was supported.</p>
<p class="tent">Having these functions continue to be tied solely to CLOCK_MONOTONIC would not work. Since the absolute value of a

different meanings in either case).</p>
<p class="tent">Two options were considered:</p>

<li class="tent">Leave the current behavior unchanged, which specifies the CLOCK_REALTIME clock for these (absolute) timeouts, to

</ol>
<p class="tent">It was decided that the features of CLOCK_MONOTONIC are not as critical to these functions as they are to <a href=

may represent a deadline for an event. When other functions are given relative timeouts, the timeouts are typically for error

<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_20" id="tag_22_02_08_20"></a>Execution Time Monitoring</h5>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Introduction
<p class="tent">The main goals of the execution time monitoring facilities defined in this chapter are to measure the execution
time of processes and threads and to allow an application to establish CPU time limits for these entities.</p>
<p class="tent">The analysis phase of time-critical realtime systems often relies on the measurement of execution times of
individual threads or processes to determine whether the timing requirements will be met. Also, performance analysis techniques for
soft deadline realtime systems rely heavily on the determination of these execution times. The execution time monitoring functions
provide application developers with the ability to measure these execution times online and open the possibility of dynamic
execution-time analysis and system reconfiguration, if required.</p>
<p class="tent">The second goal of allowing an application to establish execution time limits for individual processes or threads
and detecting when they overrun allows program robustness to be increased by enabling online checking of the execution times.</p>
<p class="tent">If errors are detectedâpossibly because of erroneous program constructs, the existence of errors in the analysis
phase, or a burst of event arrivalsâonline detection and recovery is possible in a portable way. This feature can be extremely
important for many time-critical applications. Other applications require trapping CPU-time errors as a normal way to exit an
algorithm; for instance, some realtime artificial intelligence applications trigger a number of independent inference processes of
varying accuracy and speed, limit how long they can run, and pick the best answer available when time runs out. In many periodic
systems, overrun processes are simply restarted in the next resource period, after necessary end-of-period actions have been taken.
This allows algorithms that are inherently data-dependent to be made predictable.</p>
<p class="tent">The interface that appears in this chapter defines a new type of clock, the CPU-time clock, which measures
execution time. Each process or thread can invoke the clock and timer functions defined in POSIX.1 to use them. Functions are also
provided to access the CPU-time clock of other processes or threads to enable remote monitoring of these clocks. Monitoring of
threads of other processes is not supported, since these threads are not visible from outside of their own process with the
interfaces defined in POSIX.1.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Execution Time Monitoring Interface
<p class="tent">The clock and timer interface defined in POSIX.1 historically only defined one clock, which measures wall-clock
time. The requirements for measuring execution time of processes and threads, and setting limits to their execution time by
detecting when they overrun, can be accomplished with that interface if a new kind of clock is defined. These new clocks measure
execution time, and one is associated with each process and with each thread. The clock functions currently defined in POSIX.1 can
be used to read and set these CPU-time clocks, and timers can be created using these clocks as their timing base. These timers can
then be used to send a signal when some specified execution time has been exceeded. The CPU-time clocks of each process or thread
can be accessed by using the symbols CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID or CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID.</p>
<p class="tent">The clock and timer interface defined in POSIX.1 and extended with the new kind of CPU-time clock would only allow
processes or threads to access their own CPU-time clocks. However, many realtime systems require the possibility of monitoring the
execution time of processes or threads from independent monitoring entities. In order to allow applications to construct
independent monitoring entities that do not require cooperation from or modification of the monitored entities, two functions have
been added: <a href="../functions/clock_getcpuclockid.html"><i>clock_getcpuclockid</i>()</a>, for accessing CPU-time clocks of
other processes, and <a href="../functions/pthread_getcpuclockid.html"><i>pthread_getcpuclockid</i>()</a>, for accessing CPU-time
clocks of other threads. These functions return the clock identifier associated with the process or thread specified in the call.
These clock IDs can then be used in the rest of the clock function calls.</p>
<p class="tent">The clocks accessed through these functions could also be used as a timing base for the creation of timers, thereby
allowing independent monitoring entities to limit the CPU time consumed by other entities. However, this possibility would imply
additional complexity and overhead because of the need to maintain a timer queue for each process or thread, to store the different
expiration times associated with timers created by different processes or threads. The working group decided this additional
overhead was not justified by application requirements. Therefore, creation of timers attached to the CPU-time clocks of other
processes or threads has been specified as implementation-defined.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Overhead Considerations
<p class="tent">The measurement of execution time may introduce additional overhead in the thread scheduling, because of the need
to keep track of the time consumed by each of these entities. In library-level implementations of threads, the efficiency of
scheduling could be somehow compromised because of the need to make a kernel call, at each context switch, to read the process
CPU-time clock. Consequently, a thread creation attribute called <i>cpu-clock-requirement</i> was defined, to allow threads to
disconnect their respective CPU-time clocks. However, the Ballot Group considered that this attribute itself introduced some
overhead, and that in current implementations it was not worth the effort. Therefore, the attribute was deleted, and thus thread
CPU-time clocks are required for all threads if the Thread CPU-Time Clocks option is supported.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Accuracy of CPU-Time Clocks
<p class="tent">The mechanism used to measure the execution time of processes and threads is specified in POSIX.1-2024 as
implementation-defined. The reason for this is that both the underlying hardware and the implementation architecture have a very
strong influence on the accuracy achievable for measuring CPU time. For some implementations, the specification of strict accuracy
requirements would represent very large overheads, or even the impossibility of being implemented.</p>
<p class="tent">Since the mechanism for measuring execution time is implementation-defined, realtime applications will be able to
take advantage of accurate implementations using a portable interface. Of course, strictly conforming applications cannot rely on
any particular degree of accuracy, in the same way as they cannot rely on a very accurate measurement of wall clock time. There
will always exist applications whose accuracy or efficiency requirements on the implementation are more rigid than the values
defined in POSIX.1-2024 or any other standard.</p>
<p class="tent">In any case, there is a minimum set of characteristics that realtime applications would expect from most
implementations. One such characteristic is that the sum of all the execution times of all the threads in a process equals the
process execution time, when no CPU-time clocks are disabled. This need not always be the case because implementations may differ
in how they account for time during context switches. Another characteristic is that the sum of the execution times of all
processes in a system equals the number of processors, multiplied by the elapsed time, assuming that no processor is idle during
that elapsed time. However, in some implementations it might not be possible to relate CPU time to elapsed time. For example, in a
heterogeneous multi-processor system in which each processor runs at a different speed, an implementation may choose to define each
&quot;second&quot; of CPU time to be a certain number of &quot;cycles&quot; that a CPU has executed.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Existing Practice
<p class="tent">Measuring and limiting the execution time of each concurrent activity are common features of most industrial
implementations of realtime systems. Almost all critical realtime systems are currently built upon a cyclic executive. With this
approach, a regular timer interrupt kicks off the next sequence of computations. It also checks that the current sequence has
completed. If it has not, then some error recovery action can be undertaken (or at least an overrun is avoided). Current software
engineering principles and the increasing complexity of software are driving application developers to implement these systems on
multi-threaded or multi-process operating systems. Therefore, if a POSIX operating system is to be used for this type of
application, then it must offer the same level of protection.</p>
<p class="tent">Execution time clocks are also common in most UNIX implementations, although these clocks usually have requirements
different from those of realtime applications. The POSIX.1 <a href="../functions/times.html"><i>times</i>()</a> function supports
the measurement of the execution time of the calling process, and its terminated child processes. This execution time is measured
in clock ticks and is supplied as two different values with the user and system execution times, respectively. BSD supports the
function <a href="../functions/getrusage.html"><i>getrusage</i>()</a>, which allows the calling process to get information about
the resources used by itself and/or all of its terminated child processes. The resource usage includes user and system CPU time.
Some UNIX systems have options to specify high resolution (up to one microsecond) CPU-time clocks using the <a href=
"../functions/times.html"><i>times</i>()</a> or the <a href="../functions/getrusage.html"><i>getrusage</i>()</a> functions.</p>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/times.html"><i>times</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/getrusage.html"><i>getrusage</i>()</a> interfaces do not meet important realtime requirements, such as the
possibility of monitoring execution time from a different process or thread, or the possibility of detecting an execution time
overrun. The latter requirement is supported in some UNIX implementations that are able to send a signal when the execution time of
a process has exceeded some specified value. For example, BSD defines the functions <i>getitimer</i>() and <i>setitimer</i>(),
which can operate either on a realtime clock (wall-clock), or on virtual-time or profile-time clocks which measure CPU time in two
different ways. These functions do not support access to the execution time of other processes.</p>
<p class="tent">At least one operating system supports per-process and per-thread execution time clocks, and also supports limiting
the execution time of a given process.</p>
<p class="tent">Given all this existing practice, the working group considered that the POSIX.1 clocks and timers interface was
appropriate to meet most of the requirements that realtime applications have for execution time clocks. Functions were added to get
the CPU time clock IDs, and to allow/disallow the thread CPU-time clocks (in order to preserve the efficiency of some
implementations of threads).</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Clock Constants
<p class="tent">The definition of the manifest constants CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID allows processes or
threads, respectively, to access their own execution-time clocks. However, given a process or thread, access to its own
execution-time clock is also possible if the clock ID of this clock is obtained through a call to <a href=
"../functions/clock_getcpuclockid.html"><i>clock_getcpuclockid</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/pthread_getcpuclockid.html"><i>pthread_getcpuclockid</i>()</a>. Therefore, these constants are not necessary and
could be deleted to make the interface simpler. Their existence saves one system call in the first access to the CPU-time clock of
each process or thread. The working group considered this issue and decided to leave the constants in POSIX.1-2024 because they are
closer to the POSIX.1b use of clock identifiers.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Library Implementations of Threads
<p class="tent">In library implementations of threads, kernel entities and library threads can coexist. In this case, if the
CPU-time clocks are supported, most of the clock and timer functions will need to have two implementations: one in the thread
library, and one in the system calls library. The main difference between these two implementations is that the thread library
implementation will have to deal with clocks and timers that reside in the thread space, while the kernel implementation will
operate on timers and clocks that reside in kernel space. In the library implementation, if the clock ID refers to a clock that
resides in the kernel, a kernel call will have to be made. The correct version of the function can be chosen by specifying the
appropriate order for the libraries during the link process.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">History of Resolution Issues: Deletion of the <i>enable</i> Attribute
<p class="tent">In early proposals, consideration was given to inclusion of an attribute called <i>enable</i> for CPU-time clocks.
This would allow implementations to avoid the overhead of measuring execution time for those processes or threads for which this
measurement was not required. However, this is unnecessary since processes are already required to measure execution time by the
POSIX.1 <a href="../functions/times.html"><i>times</i>()</a> function. Consequently, the <i>enable</i> attribute is not
present.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_22_02_08_21" id="tag_22_02_08_21"></a>Rationale Relating to Timeouts</h5>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Requirements for Timeouts
<p class="tent">Realtime systems which must operate reliably over extended periods without human intervention are characteristic in
embedded applications such as avionics, machine control, and space exploration, as well as more mundane applications such as cable
TV, security systems, and plant automation. A multi-tasking paradigm, in which many independent and/or cooperating software
functions relinquish the processor(s) while waiting for a specific stimulus, resource, condition, or operation completion, is very
useful in producing well engineered programs for such systems. For such systems to be robust and fault-tolerant, expected
occurrences that are unduly delayed or that never occur must be detected so that appropriate recovery actions may be taken. This is
difficult if there is no way for a task to regain control of a processor once it has relinquished control (blocked) awaiting an
occurrence which, perhaps because of corrupted code, hardware malfunction, or latent software bugs, will not happen when expected.
Therefore, the common practice in realtime operating systems is to provide a capability to time out such blocking services.
Although there are several methods to achieve this already defined by POSIX, none are as reliable or efficient as initiating a
timeout simultaneously with initiating a blocking service. This is especially critical in hard-realtime embedded systems because
the processors typically have little time reserve, and allowed fault recovery times are measured in milliseconds rather than
seconds.</p>
<p class="tent">The working group largely agreed that such timeouts were necessary and ought to become part of POSIX.1-2024,
particularly vendors of realtime operating systems whose customers had already expressed a strong need for timeouts. There was some
resistance to inclusion of timeouts in POSIX.1-2024 because the desired effect, fault tolerance, could, in theory, be achieved
using existing facilities and alternative software designs, but there was no compelling evidence that realtime system designers
would embrace such designs at the sacrifice of performance and/or simplicity.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Which Services should be Timed Out?
<p class="tent">Originally, the working group considered the prospect of providing timeouts on all blocking services, including
those currently existing in POSIX.1, POSIX.1b, and POSIX.1c, and future interfaces to be defined by other working groups, as sort
of a general policy. This was rather quickly rejected because of the scope of such a change, and the fact that many of those
services would not normally be used in a realtime context. More traditional timesharing solutions to timeout would suffice for most
of the POSIX.1 interfaces, while others had asynchronous alternatives which, while more complex to utilize, would be adequate for
some realtime and all non-realtime applications.</p>

<p class="tent">After further review by the working group, the <a href="../functions/lio_listio.html"><i>lio_listio</i>()</a>,
<a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> functions (all forms
of blocking synchronous I/O) were eliminated from the list because of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Asynchronous alternatives exist</li>
<li class="tent">Timeouts can be implemented, albeit non-portably, in device drivers</li>
<li class="tent">A strong desire not to introduce modifications to POSIX.1 interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">The working group ultimately rejected <a href="../functions/pthread_join.html"><i>pthread_join</i>()</a> since both
that interface and a timed variant of that interface are non-minimal and may be implemented as a function. See below for a library
implementation of <a href="../functions/pthread_join.html"><i>pthread_join</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">Thus, there was a consensus among the working group members to add timeouts to 4 of the remaining 5 functions (the
timeout for <a href="../functions/aio_suspend.html"><i>aio_suspend</i>()</a> was ultimately added directly to POSIX.1b, while the
others were added by POSIX.1d). However, <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a> remained
contentious.</p>
<p class="tent">Many feel that <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a> falls into the same
class as the other functions; that is, it is desirable to time out a mutex lock because a mutex may fail to be unlocked due to
errant or corrupted code in a critical section (looping or branching outside of the unlock code), and therefore is equally in need
of a reliable, simple, and efficient timeout. In fact, since mutexes are intended to guard small critical sections, most <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a> calls would be expected to obtain the lock without blocking
nor utilizing any kernel service, even in implementations of threads with global contention scope; the timeout alternative need
only be considered after it is determined that the thread must block.</p>
<p class="tent">Those opposed to timing out mutexes feel that the very simplicity of the mutex is compromised by adding a timeout
semantic, and that to do so is senseless. They claim that if a timed mutex is really deemed useful by a particular application,
then it can be constructed from the facilities already in POSIX.1b and POSIX.1c. The following two C-language library
implementations of mutex locking with timeout represent the solutions offered (in both implementations, the timeout parameter is
specified as absolute time, not relative time as in the proposed POSIX.1c interfaces).<br></p>

<p class="tent">The Spinlock implementation is generally unsuitable for any application using priority-based thread scheduling
policies such as SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, since the mutex could currently be held by a thread of lower priority within the same
allocation domain, but since the waiting thread never blocks, only threads of equal or higher priority will ever run, and the mutex
cannot be unlocked. Setting priority inheritance or priority ceiling protocol on the mutex does not solve this problem, since the
priority of a mutex owning thread is only boosted if higher priority threads are blocked waiting for the mutex; clearly not the
case for this spinlock.</p>

desired <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_timedlock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>()</a>. Since waits on condition
variables currently do not include protocols which avoid priority inversion, this method is generally unsuitable for realtime
applications because it does not provide the same priority inversion protection as the untimed <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a>. Also, for any given implementations of the current mutex
and condition variable primitives, this library implementation has a performance cost at least 2.5 times that of the untimed
<a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a> even in the case where the timed mutex is readily
locked without blocking (the interfaces required for this case are shown in bold). Even in uniprocessors or where assignment is

<a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_timedlock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>()</a> could be implemented at effectively no
performance penalty in this case because the timeout parameters need only be considered after it is determined that the mutex
cannot be locked immediately.</p>
<p class="tent">Thus it has not yet been shown that the full semantics of mutex locking with timeout can be efficiently and
reliably achieved using existing interfaces. Even if the existence of an acceptable library implementation were proven, it is
difficult to justify why the interface itself should not be made portable, especially considering approval for the other four

<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/pthread_join.html"><i>pthread_join</i>()</a> C-language example shown above demonstrates
that it is possible, using existing pthread facilities, to construct a variety of thread which allows for joining such a thread,
but which allows the join operation to time out. It does this by using a <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> to wait for the thread to exit. A
<b>timed_thread_t</b> descriptor structure is used to pass parameters from the creating thread to the created thread, and from the
exiting thread to the joining thread. This implementation is roughly equivalent to what a normal <a href=
"../functions/pthread_join.html"><i>pthread_join</i>()</a> implementation would do, with the single change being that <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> is used in place of a simple <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_wait.html"><i>pthread_cond_wait</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">Since it is possible to implement such a facility entirely from existing pthread interfaces, and with roughly equal
efficiency and complexity to an implementation which would be provided directly by a pthreads implementation, it was the consensus
of the working group members that any <i>pthread_timedjoin</i>() facility would be unnecessary, and should not be provided.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Form of the Timeout Interfaces
<p class="tent">The working group considered a number of alternative ways to add timeouts to blocking services. At first, a system
interface which would specify a one-shot or persistent timeout to be applied to subsequent blocking services invoked by the calling
process or thread was considered because it allowed all blocking services to be timed out in a uniform manner with a single
additional interface; this was rather quickly rejected because it could easily result in the wrong services being timed out.</p>
<p class="tent">It was suggested that a timeout value might be specified as an attribute of the object (semaphore, mutex, message
queue, and so on), but there was no consensus on this, either on a case-by-case basis or for all timeouts.</p>
<p class="tent">Looking at the two existing timeouts for blocking services indicates that the working group members favor a
separate interface for the timed version of a function. However, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> utilizes an absolute timeout value while <a href=
"../functions/sigtimedwait.html"><i>sigtimedwait</i>()</a> uses a relative timeout value. The working group members agreed that
relative timeout values are appropriate where the timeout mechanism's primary use was to deal with an unexpected or error
situation, but they are inappropriate when the timeout must expire at a particular time, or before a specific deadline. For the
timeouts being introduced in POSIX.1-2024, the working group considered allowing both relative and absolute timeouts as is done
with POSIX.1b timers, but ultimately favored the simpler absolute timeout form.</p>
<p class="tent">An absolute time measure can be easily implemented on top of an interface that specifies relative time, by reading
the clock, calculating the difference between the current time and the desired wakeup time, and issuing a relative timeout call.
But there is a race condition with this approach because the thread could be preempted after reading the clock, but before making
the timed-out call; in this case, the thread would be awakened later than it should and, thus, if the wakeup time represented a
deadline, it would miss it.</p>
<p class="tent">There is also a race condition when trying to build a relative timeout on top of an interface that specifies
absolute timeouts. In this case, the clock would have to be read to calculate the absolute wakeup time as the sum of the current
time plus the relative timeout interval. In this case, if the thread is preempted after reading the clock but before making the
timed-out call, the thread would be awakened earlier than desired.</p>
<p class="tent">But the race condition with the absolute timeouts interface is not as bad as the one that happens with the relative
timeout interface, because there are simple workarounds. For the absolute timeouts interface, if the timing requirement is a
deadline, the deadline can still be met because the thread woke up earlier than the deadline. If the timeout is just used as an
error recovery mechanism, the precision of timing is not really important. If the timing requirement is that between actions A and
B a minimum interval of time must elapse, the absolute timeout interface can be safely used by reading the clock after action A has
been started. It could be argued that, since the call with the absolute timeout is atomic from the application point of view, it is
not possible to read the clock after action A, if this action is part of the timed-out call. But looking at the nature of the calls
for which timeouts are specified (locking a mutex, waiting for a semaphore, waiting for a message, or waiting until there is space
in a message queue), the timeouts that an application would build on these actions would not be triggered by these actions
themselves, but by some other external action. For example, if waiting for a message to arrive to a message queue, and waiting for
at least 20 milliseconds, this time interval would start to be counted from some event that would trigger both the action that
produces the message, as well as the action that waits for the message to arrive, and not by the wait-for-message operation itself.
In this case, the workaround proposed above could be used.</p>
<p class="tent">For these reasons, the absolute timeout is preferred over the relative timeout interface.</p>

</ul>
<h4><a name="tag_22_02_09" id="tag_22_02_09"></a>B.2.9 Threads</h4>
<p class="tent">Threads will normally be more expensive than subroutines (or functions, routines, and so on) if specialized
hardware support is not provided. Nevertheless, threads should be sufficiently efficient to encourage their use as a medium to
fine-grained structuring mechanism for parallelism in an application. Structuring an application using threads then allows it to
take immediate advantage of any underlying parallelism available in the host environment. This means implementors are encouraged to
optimize for fast execution at the possible expense of efficient utilization of storage. For example, a common thread creation
technique is to cache appropriate thread data structures. That is, rather than releasing system resources, the implementation
retains these resources and reuses them when the program next asks to create a new thread. If this reuse of thread resources is to
be possible, there has to be very little unique state associated with each thread, because any such state has to be reset when the
thread is reused.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_01" id="tag_22_02_09_01"></a>Thread Creation Attributes</h5>
<p class="tent">Attributes objects are provided for threads, mutexes, and condition variables as a mechanism to support probable
future standardization in these areas without requiring that the interface itself be changed.</p>
<p class="tent">Attributes objects provide clean isolation of the configurable aspects of threads. For example, &quot;stack size&quot; is
an important attribute of a thread, but it cannot be expressed portably. When porting a threaded program, stack sizes often need to
be adjusted. The use of attributes objects can help by allowing the changes to be isolated in a single place, rather than being
spread across every instance of thread creation.</p>
<p class="tent">Attributes objects can be used to set up <i>classes</i> of threads with similar attributes; for example, &quot;threads
with large stacks and high priority&quot; or &quot;threads with minimal stacks&quot;. These classes can be defined in a single place and then
referenced wherever threads need to be created. Changes to &quot;class&quot; decisions become straightforward, and detailed analysis of
each <a href="../functions/pthread_create.html"><i>pthread_create</i>()</a> call is not required.</p>
<p class="tent">The attributes objects are defined as opaque types as an aid to extensibility. If these objects had been specified
as structures, adding new attributes would force recompilation of all multi-threaded programs when the attributes objects are
extended; this might not be possible if different program components were supplied by different vendors.</p>
<p class="tent">Additionally, opaque attributes objects present opportunities for improving performance. Argument validity can be
checked once when attributes are set, rather than each time a thread is created. Implementations will often need to cache kernel
objects that are expensive to create. Opaque attributes objects provide an efficient mechanism to detect when cached objects become
invalid due to attribute changes.</p>
<p class="tent">Because assignment is not necessarily defined on a given opaque type, implementation-defined default values cannot
be defined in a portable way. The solution to this problem is to allow attribute objects to be initialized dynamically by
attributes object initialization functions, so that default values can be supplied automatically by the implementation.</p>
<p class="tent">The following proposal was provided as a suggested alternative to the supplied attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">Maintain the style of passing a parameter formed by the bitwise-inclusive OR of flags to the initialization
routines (<a href="../functions/pthread_create.html"><i>pthread_create</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutex_init.html"><i>pthread_mutex_init</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_init.html"><i>pthread_cond_init</i>()</a>). The parameter containing the flags should be an opaque type
for extensibility. If no flags are set in the parameter, then the objects are created with default characteristics. An
implementation may specify implementation-defined flag values and associated behavior.</li>
<li class="tent">If further specialization of mutexes and condition variables is necessary, implementations may specify additional
procedures that operate on the <b>pthread_mutex_t</b> and <b>pthread_cond_t</b> objects (instead of on attributes objects).</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">The difficulties with this solution are:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">A bitmask is not opaque if bits have to be set into bit-vector attributes objects using explicitly-coded
bitwise-inclusive OR operations. If the set of options exceeds an <b>int</b>, application programmers need to know the location of
each bit. If bits are set or read by encapsulation (that is, <i>get*</i>() or <i>set*</i>() functions), then the bitmask is merely
an implementation of attributes objects as currently defined and should not be exposed to the programmer.</li>
<li class="tent">Many attributes are not Boolean or very small integral values. For example, scheduling policy may be placed in 3
bits or 4 bits, but priority requires 5 bits or more, thereby taking up at least 8 bits out of a possible 16 bits on machines with
16-bit integers. Because of this, the bitmask can only reasonably control whether particular attributes are set or not, and it
cannot serve as the repository of the value itself. The value needs to be specified as a function parameter (which is
non-extensible), or by setting a structure field (which is non-opaque), or by <i>get*</i>() and <i>set*</i>() functions (making the
bitmask a redundant addition to the attributes objects).</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">Stack size is defined as an optional attribute because the very notion of a stack is inherently machine-dependent.
Some implementations may not be able to change the size of the stack, for example, and others may not need to because stack pages
may be discontiguous and can be allocated and released on demand.</p>
<p class="tent">The attribute mechanism has been designed in large measure for extensibility. Future extensions to the attribute
mechanism or to any attributes object defined in POSIX.1-2024 have to be done with care so as not to affect
binary-compatibility.</p>
<p class="tent">Attribute objects, even if allocated by means of dynamic allocation functions such as <a href=
"../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a>, may have their size fixed at compile time. This means, for example, a <a href=
"../functions/pthread_create.html"><i>pthread_create</i>()</a> in an implementation with extensions to the <b>pthread_attr_t</b>
cannot look beyond the area that the binary application assumes is valid. This suggests that implementations should maintain a size
field in the attributes object, as well as possibly version information, if extensions in different directions (possibly by
different vendors) are to be accommodated.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_02" id="tag_22_02_09_02"></a>Thread Implementation Models</h5>
<p class="tent">There are various thread implementation models. At one end of the spectrum is the &quot;library-thread model&quot;. In such
a model, the threads of a process are not visible to the operating system kernel, and the threads are not kernel-scheduled
entities. The process is the only kernel-scheduled entity. The process is scheduled onto the processor by the kernel according to
the scheduling attributes of the process. The threads are scheduled onto the single kernel-scheduled entity (the process) by the
runtime library according to the scheduling attributes of the threads. A problem with this model is that it constrains concurrency.
Since there is only one kernel-scheduled entity (namely, the process), only one thread per process can execute at a time. If the
thread that is executing blocks on I/O, then the whole process blocks.</p>
<p class="tent">At the other end of the spectrum is the &quot;kernel-thread model&quot;. In this model, all threads are visible to the
operating system kernel. Thus, all threads are kernel-scheduled entities, and all threads can concurrently execute. The threads are
scheduled onto processors by the kernel according to the scheduling attributes of the threads. The drawback to this model is that
the creation and management of the threads entails operating system calls, as opposed to subroutine calls, which makes kernel
threads heavier weight than library threads.</p>
<p class="tent">Hybrids of these two models are common. A hybrid model offers the speed of library threads and the concurrency of
kernel threads. In hybrid models, a process has some (relatively small) number of kernel scheduled entities associated with it. It
also has a potentially much larger number of library threads associated with it. Some library threads may be bound to
kernel-scheduled entities, while the other library threads are multiplexed onto the remaining kernel-scheduled entities. There are
two levels of thread scheduling:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">The runtime library manages the scheduling of (unbound) library threads onto kernel-scheduled entities.</li>
<li class="tent">The kernel manages the scheduling of kernel-scheduled entities onto processors.</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">For this reason, a hybrid model is referred to as a two-level threads scheduling model. In this model, the process
can have multiple concurrently executing threads; specifically, it can have as many concurrently executing threads as it has
kernel-scheduled entities.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_03" id="tag_22_02_09_03"></a>Thread-Specific Data</h5>
<p class="tent">Many applications require that a certain amount of context be maintained on a per-thread basis across procedure
calls. A common example is a multi-threaded library routine that allocates resources from a common pool and maintains an active
resource list for each thread. The thread-specific data interface provided to meet these needs may be viewed as a two-dimensional
array of values with keys serving as the row index and thread IDs as the column index (although the implementation need not work
this way).<br></p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Models
<p class="tent">Three possible thread-specific data models were considered:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">No Explicit Support
<p class="tent">A standard thread-specific data interface is not strictly necessary to support applications that require per-thread
context. One could, for example, provide a hash function that converted a <b>pthread_t</b> into an integer value that could then be
used to index into a global array of per-thread data pointers. This hash function, in conjunction with <a href=
"../functions/pthread_self.html"><i>pthread_self</i>()</a>, would be all the interface required to support a mechanism of this
sort. Unfortunately, this technique is cumbersome. It can lead to duplicated code as each set of cooperating modules implements
their own per-thread data management schemes. This technique would also require that <b>pthread_t</b> not be an opaque type.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Single (<b>void</b> *) Pointer
<p class="tent">Another technique would be to provide a single word of per-thread storage and a pair of functions to fetch and
store the value of this word. The word could then hold a pointer to a block of per-thread memory. The allocation, partitioning, and
general use of this memory would be entirely up to the application. Although this method is not as problematic as technique 1, it
suffers from interoperability problems. For example, all modules using the per-thread pointer would have to agree on a common usage
protocol.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Key/Value Mechanism
<p class="tent">This method associates an opaque key (for example, stored in a variable of type <b>pthread_key_t</b>) with each
per-thread datum. These keys play the role of identifiers for per-thread data. This technique is the most generic and avoids the
problems noted above, albeit at the cost of some complexity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">The primary advantage of the third model is its information hiding properties. Modules using this model are free to
create and use their own key(s) independent of all other such usage, whereas the other models require that all modules that use
thread-specific context explicitly cooperate with all other such modules. The data-independence provided by the third model is
worth the additional interface. Therefore, the third model was chosen.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Requirements
<p class="tent">It is important that it be possible to implement the thread-specific data interface without the use of thread
private memory. To do otherwise would increase the weight of each thread, thereby limiting the range of applications for which the
threads interfaces provided by POSIX.1-2024 is appropriate.</p>
<p class="tent">The values that one binds to the key via <a href=
"../functions/pthread_setspecific.html"><i>pthread_setspecific</i>()</a> may, in fact, be pointers to shared storage locations
available to all threads. It is only the key/value bindings that are maintained on a per-thread basis, and these can be kept in any
portion of the address space that is reserved for use by the calling thread (for example, on the stack). Thus, no per-thread MMU
state is required to implement the interface. On the other hand, there is nothing in the interface specification to preclude the
use of a per-thread MMU state if it is available (for example, the key values returned by <a href=
"../functions/pthread_key_create.html"><i>pthread_key_create</i>()</a> could be thread private memory addresses).</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Standardization Issues
<p class="tent">Thread-specific data is a requirement for a usable thread interface. The binding described in this section provides
a portable thread-specific data mechanism for languages that do not directly support a thread-specific storage class. A binding to
POSIX.1-2024 for a language that does include such a storage class need not provide this specific interface.</p>
<p class="tent">If a language were to include the notion of thread-specific storage, it would be desirable (but <i>not</i>
required) to provide an implementation of the pthreads thread-specific data interface based on the language feature. For example,
assume that a compiler for a C-like language supports a <i>private</i> storage class that provides thread-specific storage.
Something similar to the following macros might be used to effect a compatible implementation:</p>
<pre>
<tt>#define pthread_key_t                   private void *
#define pthread_key_create(key)         /* no-op */
#define pthread_setspecific(key,value)  (key)=(value)
#define pthread_getspecific(key)        (key)
</tt></pre>
<basefont size="2">
<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>For the sake of clarity, this example ignores destructor functions. A correct implementation would have to support them.</dd>

<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_04" id="tag_22_02_09_04"></a>Barriers</h5>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Background
<p class="tent">Barriers are typically used in parallel DO/FOR loops to ensure that all threads have reached a particular stage in
a parallel computation before allowing any to proceed to the next stage. Highly efficient implementation is possible on machines
which support a &quot;Fetch and Add&quot; operation as described in the referenced Almasi and Gottlieb (1989).</p>
<p class="tent">The use of return value PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD is shown in the following example:</p>
<pre>
<tt>if ( (status=pthread_barrier_wait(&amp;barrier)) ==
    PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD) {
    ...serial section
}
else if (status != 0) {
    ...error processing
}
status=pthread_barrier_wait(&amp;barrier);
...
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">This behavior allows a serial section of code to be executed by one thread as soon as all threads reach the first
barrier. The second barrier prevents the other threads from proceeding until the serial section being executed by the one thread
has completed.</p>
<p class="tent">Although barriers can be implemented with mutexes and condition variables, the referenced Almasi and Gottlieb
(1989) provides ample illustration that such implementations are significantly less efficient than is possible. While the relative
efficiency of barriers may well vary by implementation, it is important that they be recognized in the POSIX.1-2024 to facilitate
applications portability while providing the necessary freedom to implementors.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Lack of Timeout Feature
<p class="tent">Alternate versions of most blocking routines have been provided to support watchdog timeouts. No alternate
interface of this sort has been provided for barrier waits for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Multiple threads may use different timeout values, some of which may be indefinite. It is not clear which threads
should break through the barrier with a timeout error if and when these timeouts expire.</li>
<li class="tent">The barrier may become unusable once a thread breaks out of a <a href=
"../functions/pthread_barrier_wait.html"><i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>()</a> with a timeout error. There is, in general, no way to
guarantee the consistency of a barrier's internal data structures once a thread has timed out of a <a href=
"../functions/pthread_barrier_wait.html"><i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>()</a>. Even the inclusion of a special barrier
reinitialization function would not help much since it is not clear how this function would affect the behavior of threads that
reach the barrier between the original timeout and the call to the reinitialization function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_05" id="tag_22_02_09_05"></a>Spin Locks</h5>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Background
<p class="tent">Spin locks represent an extremely low-level synchronization mechanism suitable primarily for use on shared memory
multi-processors. It is typically an atomically modified Boolean value that is set to one when the lock is held and to zero when
the lock is freed.</p>
<p class="tent">When a caller requests a spin lock that is already held, it typically spins in a loop testing whether the lock has
become available. Such spinning wastes processor cycles so the lock should only be held for short durations and not across
sleep/block operations. Callers should unlock spin locks before calling sleep operations.</p>
<p class="tent">Spin locks are available on a variety of systems. The functions included in POSIX.1-2024 are an attempt to
standardize that existing practice.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Lack of Timeout Feature
<p class="tent">Alternate versions of most blocking routines have been provided to support watchdog timeouts. No alternate
interface of this sort has been provided for spin locks for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">It is impossible to determine appropriate timeout intervals for spin locks in a portable manner. The amount of
time one can expect to spend spin-waiting is inversely proportional to the degree of parallelism provided by the system.
<p class="tent">It can vary from a few cycles when each competing thread is running on its own processor, to an indefinite amount
of time when all threads are multiplexed on a single processor (which is why spin locking is not advisable on uniprocessors).</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">When used properly, the amount of time the calling thread spends waiting on a spin lock should be considerably
less than the time required to set up a corresponding watchdog timer. Since the primary purpose of spin locks is to provide a
low-overhead synchronization mechanism for multi-processors, the overhead of a timeout mechanism was deemed unacceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">It was also suggested that an additional <i>count</i> argument be provided (on the <a href=
"../functions/pthread_spin_lock.html"><i>pthread_spin_lock</i>()</a> call) in <i>lieu</i> of a true timeout so that a spin lock
call could fail gracefully if it was unable to apply the lock after <i>count</i> attempts. This idea was rejected because it is not
existing practice. Furthermore, the same effect can be obtained with <a href=
"../functions/pthread_spin_trylock.html"><i>pthread_spin_trylock</i>()</a>, as illustrated below:</p>
<pre>
<tt>int n = MAX_SPIN;
<br class="tent">
while ( --n &gt;= 0 )
{
    if ( !pthread_spin_try_lock(...) )
        break;
}
if ( n &gt;= 0 )
{
    /* Successfully acquired the lock */
}
else
{
    /* Unable to acquire the lock */
}
</tt></pre></li>
<li class="tent"><i>process-shared</i> Attribute
<p class="tent">The initialization functions associated with most POSIX synchronization objects (for example, mutexes, barriers,
and read-write locks) take an attributes object with a <i>process-shared</i> attribute that specifies whether or not the object is
to be shared across processes. In the draft corresponding to the first balloting round, two separate initialization functions are
provided for spin locks, however: one for spin locks that were to be shared across processes (<i>spin_init</i>()), and one for
locks that were only used by multiple threads within a single process (<a href=
"../functions/pthread_spin_init.html"><i>pthread_spin_init</i>()</a>). This was done so as to keep the overhead associated with
spin waiting to an absolute minimum. However, the balloting group requested that, since the overhead associated to a bit check was
small, spin locks should be consistent with the rest of the synchronization primitives, and thus the <i>process-shared</i>
attribute was introduced for spin locks.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Spin Locks <i>versus</i> Mutexes
<p class="tent">It has been suggested that mutexes are an adequate synchronization mechanism and spin locks are not necessary.
Locking mechanisms typically must trade off the processor resources consumed while setting up to block the thread and the processor
resources consumed by the thread while it is blocked. Spin locks require very little resources to set up the blocking of a thread.
Existing practice is to simply loop, repeating the atomic locking operation until the lock is available. While the resources
consumed to set up blocking of the thread are low, the thread continues to consume processor resources while it is waiting.</p>
<p class="tent">On the other hand, mutexes may be implemented such that the processor resources consumed to block the thread are
large relative to a spin lock. After detecting that the mutex lock is not available, the thread must alter its scheduling state,
add itself to a set of waiting threads, and, when the lock becomes available again, undo all of this before taking over ownership
of the mutex. However, while a thread is blocked by a mutex, no processor resources are consumed.</p>
<p class="tent">Therefore, spin locks and mutexes may be implemented to have different characteristics. Spin locks may have lower
overall overhead for very short-term blocking, and mutexes may have lower overall overhead when a thread will be blocked for longer
periods of time. The presence of both interfaces allows implementations with these two different characteristics, both of which may
be useful to a particular application.</p>
<p class="tent">It has also been suggested that applications can build their own spin locks from the <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutex_trylock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_trylock</i>()</a> function:</p>
<pre>
<tt>while (pthread_mutex_trylock(&amp;mutex));
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">The apparent simplicity of this construct is somewhat deceiving, however. While the actual wait is quite efficient,
various guarantees on the integrity of mutex objects (for example, priority inheritance rules) may add overhead to the successful
path of the trylock operation that is not required of spin locks. One could, of course, add an attribute to the mutex to bypass
such overhead, but the very act of finding and testing this attribute represents more overhead than is found in the typical spin
lock.</p>
<p class="tent">The need to hold spin lock overhead to an absolute minimum also makes it impossible to provide guarantees against
starvation similar to those provided for mutexes or read-write locks. The overhead required to implement such guarantees (for
example, disabling preemption before spinning) may well exceed the overhead of the spin wait itself by many orders of magnitude. If
a &quot;safe&quot; spin wait seems desirable, it can always be provided (albeit at some performance cost) via appropriate mutex
attributes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_06" id="tag_22_02_09_06"></a>Robust Mutexes</h5>
<p class="tent">Robust mutexes are intended to protect applications that use mutexes to protect data shared between different
processes. If a process is terminated by a signal while a thread is holding a mutex, there is no chance for the process to clean up
after it. Waiters for the locked mutex might wait indefinitely.</p>
<p class="tent">With robust mutexes the problem can be solved: whenever a fatal signal terminates a process, current or future
waiters of the mutex are notified about this fact. The locking function provides notification of this condition through the error
condition [EOWNERDEAD]. A thread then has the chance to clean up the state protected by the mutex and mark the state as consistent
again by a call to <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_consistent.html"><i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>()</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">Pre-existing implementations have used the semantics of robust mutexes for a variety of situations, some of them
not defined in the standard. Where a normally terminated process (i.e., when one thread calls <a href=
"../functions/exit.html"><i>exit</i>()</a>) causes notification of other waiters of robust mutexes if the mutex is locked by any
thread in the process. This behavior is defined in the standard and makes sense because no thread other than the thread calling
<a href="../functions/exit.html"><i>exit</i>()</a> has the chance to clean up its data.</p>
<p class="tent">If a thread is terminated by cancellation or if it calls <a href=
"../functions/pthread_exit.html"><i>pthread_exit</i>()</a>, the situation is different. In both these situations the thread has the
chance to clean up after itself by registering appropriate cleanup handlers. There is no real reason to demand that other waiters
for a robust mutex the terminating thread owns are notified. The committee felt that this is actively encouraging bad practice
because programmers are tempted to rely on the robust mutex semantics instead of correctly cleaning up after themselves.</p>
<p class="tent">Therefore, the standard does not require notification of other waiters at the time a thread is terminated while the
process continues to run. The mutex is still recognized as being locked by the process (with the thread gone it makes no sense to
refer to the thread owning the mutex). Therefore, a terminating process will cause notifications about the dead owner to be sent to
all waiters. This delay in the notification is not required, but programmers cannot rely on prompt notification after a thread is
terminated.</p>
<p class="tent">For the same reason is it not required that an implementation supports robust mutexes that are not shared between
processes. If a robust mutex is used only within one process, all the cleanup can be performed by the threads themselves by
registering appropriate cleanup handlers. Fatal signals are of no importance in this case because after the signal is delivered
there is no thread remaining to use the mutex.</p>
<p class="tent">Some implementations might choose to support intra-process robust mutexes and they might also send notification of
a dead owner right after the previous owner died. But applications must not rely on this. Applications should only use robust
mutexes for the purpose of handling fatal signals in situations where inter-process mutexes are in use.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_08" id="tag_22_02_09_08"></a>Threads Extensions</h5>
<p class="tent">The following extensions to the IEEE&nbsp;P1003.1c draft standard are now supported in POSIX.1-2024 as part of the
alignment with the Single UNIX Specification:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Extended mutex attribute types</li>
<li class="tent">Read-write locks and attributes (also introduced by the IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1j-2000 amendment)</li>
<li class="tent">Thread concurrency level</li>
<li class="tent">Thread stack guard size</li>
<li class="tent">Parallel I/O</li>
<li class="tent">Robust mutexes</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">These extensions carefully follow the threads programming model specified in POSIX.1c. As with POSIX.1c, all the
new functions return zero if successful; otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.</p>
<p class="tent">The concept of attribute objects was introduced in POSIX.1c to allow implementations to extend POSIX.1-2024 without
changing the existing interfaces. Attribute objects were defined for threads, mutexes, and condition variables. Attributes objects
are defined as implementation-defined opaque types to aid extensibility, and functions are defined to allow attributes to be set or
retrieved. This model has been followed when adding the new type attribute of <b>pthread_mutexattr_t</b> or the new read-write lock
attributes object <b>pthread_rwlockattr_t</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Extended Mutex Attributes
<p class="tent">POSIX.1c defines a mutex attributes object as an implementation-defined opaque object of type
<b>pthread_mutexattr_t</b>, and specifies a number of attributes which this object must have and a number of functions which
manipulate these attributes. These attributes include <i>detachstate</i>, <i>inheritsched</i>, <i>schedparm</i>,
<i>schedpolicy</i>, <i>contentionscope</i>, <i>stackaddr</i>, and <i>stacksize</i>.</p>
<p class="tent">The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 specifies another mutex attribute called <i>type</i>. The <i>type</i>
attribute allows applications to specify the behavior of mutex locking operations in situations where POSIX.1c behavior is
undefined. The OSF DCE threads implementation, based on Draft 4 of POSIX.1c, specified a similar attribute. Note that the names of
the attributes have changed somewhat from the OSF DCE threads implementation.</p>
<p class="tent">The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 also extends the specification of the following POSIX.1c functions
which manipulate mutexes:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a>
<a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_trylock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_trylock</i>()</a>
<a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_unlock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>()</a>
</pre></blockquote>
<p class="tent">to take account of the new mutex attribute type and to specify behavior which was declared as undefined in
POSIX.1c. How a calling thread acquires or releases a mutex now depends upon the mutex <i>type</i> attribute.</p>
<p class="tent">The <i>type</i> attribute can have the following values:</p>
<dl compact>
<dd></dd>
<dt>PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL</dt>
<dd><br>
Basic mutex with no specific error checking built in. Does not report a deadlock error.</dd>
<dt>PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE</dt>
<dd><br>
Allows any thread to recursively lock a mutex. The mutex must be unlocked an equal number of times to release the mutex.</dd>
<dt>PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK</dt>
<dd><br>
Detects and reports simple usage errors; that is, an attempt to unlock a mutex that is not locked by the calling thread or that is
not locked at all, or an attempt to relock a mutex the thread already owns.</dd>
<dt>PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT</dt>
<dd><br>
The default mutex type. May be mapped to any of the above mutex types or may be an implementation-defined type.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="tent"><i>Normal</i> mutexes do not detect deadlock conditions; for example, a thread will hang if it tries to relock a
normal mutex that it already owns. Attempting to unlock a mutex locked by another thread, or unlocking an unlocked mutex, results
in undefined behavior. Normal mutexes will usually be the fastest type of mutex available on a platform but provide the least error
checking.</p>
<p class="tent"><i>Recursive</i> mutexes are useful for converting old code where it is difficult to establish clear boundaries of
synchronization. A thread can relock a recursive mutex without first unlocking it. The relocking deadlock which can occur with
normal mutexes cannot occur with this type of mutex. However, multiple locks of a recursive mutex require the same number of
unlocks to release the mutex before another thread can acquire the mutex. Furthermore, this type of mutex maintains the concept of
an owner. Thus, a thread attempting to unlock a recursive mutex which another thread has locked returns with an error. A thread
attempting to unlock a recursive mutex that is not locked returns with an error. Never use a recursive mutex with condition
variables because the implicit unlock performed by <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_clockwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_clockwait</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a>, or <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_wait.html"><i>pthread_cond_wait</i>()</a> will not actually release the mutex if it had been locked
multiple times.</p>
<p class="tent"><i>Errorcheck</i> mutexes provide error checking and are useful primarily as a debugging aid. A thread attempting
to relock an errorcheck mutex without first unlocking it returns with an error. Again, this type of mutex maintains the concept of
an owner. Thus, a thread attempting to unlock an errorcheck mutex which another thread has locked returns with an error. A thread
attempting to unlock an errorcheck mutex that is not locked also returns with an error. It should be noted that errorcheck mutexes
will almost always be much slower than normal mutexes due to the extra state checks performed.</p>
<p class="tent">The default mutex type provides implementation-defined error checking. The default mutex may be mapped to one of
the other defined types or may be something entirely different. This enables each vendor to provide the mutex semantics which the
vendor feels will be most useful to their target users. Most vendors will probably choose to make normal mutexes the default so as
to give applications the benefit of the fastest type of mutexes available on their platform. Check your implementation's
documentation.</p>
<p class="tent">An application developer can use any of the mutex types almost interchangeably as long as the application does not
depend upon the implementation detecting (or failing to detect) any particular errors. Note that a recursive mutex can be used with
condition variable waits as long as the application never recursively locks the mutex.</p>
<p class="tent">Two functions are provided for manipulating the <i>type</i> attribute of a mutex attributes object. This attribute
is set or returned in the <i>type</i> parameter of these functions. The <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutexattr_settype.html"><i>pthread_mutexattr_settype</i>()</a> function is used to set a specific type value
while <a href="../functions/pthread_mutexattr_gettype.html"><i>pthread_mutexattr_gettype</i>()</a> is used to return the type of
the mutex. Setting the <i>type</i> attribute of a mutex attributes object affects only mutexes initialized using that mutex
attributes object. Changing the <i>type</i> attribute does not affect mutexes previously initialized using that mutex attributes
object.</p>

<li class="tent">Read-Write Locks and Attributes
<p class="tent">The read-write locks introduced have been harmonized with those in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1j-2000; see also
<a href="#tag_22_02_09_27">B.2.9.6 Thread Read-Write Locks</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">Read-write locks (also known as reader-writer locks) allow a thread to exclusively lock some shared data while
updating that data, or allow any number of threads to have simultaneous read-only access to the data.</p>
<p class="tent">Unlike a mutex, a read-write lock distinguishes between reading data and writing data. A mutex excludes all other
threads. A read-write lock allows other threads access to the data, providing no thread is modifying the data. Thus, a read-write
lock is less primitive than either a mutex-condition variable pair or a semaphore.</p>
<p class="tent">Application developers should consider using a read-write lock rather than a mutex to protect data that is
frequently referenced but seldom modified. Most threads (readers) will be able to read the data without waiting and will only have
to block when some other thread (a writer) is in the process of modifying the data. Conversely a thread that wants to change the
data is forced to wait until there are no readers. This type of lock is often used to facilitate parallel access to data on
multi-processor platforms or to avoid context switches on single processor platforms where multiple threads access the same
data.</p>
<p class="tent">If a read-write lock becomes unlocked and there are multiple threads waiting to acquire the write lock, the
implementation's scheduling policy determines which thread acquires the read-write lock for writing. If there are multiple threads
blocked on a read-write lock for both read locks and write locks, it is unspecified whether the readers or a writer acquire the
lock first. However, for performance reasons, implementations often favor writers over readers to avoid potential writer
starvation.</p>
<p class="tent">A read-write lock object is an implementation-defined opaque object of type <b>pthread_rwlock_t</b> as defined in
<a href="../basedefs/pthread.h.html"><i>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</i></a>. There are two different sorts of locks associated with a
read-write lock: a read lock and a write lock.</p>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/pthread_rwlockattr_init.html"><i>pthread_rwlockattr_init</i>()</a> function initializes a
read-write lock attributes object with the default value for all the attributes defined in the implementation. After a read-write
lock attributes object has been used to initialize one or more read-write locks, changes to the read-write lock attributes object,
including destruction, do not affect previously initialized read-write locks.</p>
<p class="tent">Implementations must provide at least the read-write lock attribute <i>process-shared</i>. This attribute can have
the following values:</p>
<dl compact>
<dd></dd>
<dt>PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED</dt>
<dd><br>
Any thread of any process that has access to the memory where the read-write lock resides can manipulate the read-write lock.</dd>
<dt>PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE</dt>
<dd><br>
Only threads created within the same process as the thread that initialized the read-write lock can manipulate the read-write lock.
This is the default value.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared.html"><i>pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared</i>()</a> function
is used to set the <i>process-shared</i> attribute of an initialized read-write lock attributes object while the function <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared.html"><i>pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared</i>()</a> obtains the current value of the
<i>process-shared</i> attribute.</p>
<p class="tent">A read-write lock attributes object is destroyed using the <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlockattr_destroy.html"><i>pthread_rwlockattr_destroy</i>()</a> function. The effect of subsequent use of
the read-write lock attributes object is undefined.</p>
<p class="tent">A thread creates a read-write lock using the <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_init.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>()</a> function. The attributes of the read-write lock can be
specified by the application developer; otherwise, the default implementation-defined read-write lock attributes are used if the
pointer to the read-write lock attributes object is NULL. In cases where the default attributes are appropriate, the
PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER macro can be used to initialize read-write locks.</p>
<p class="tent">A thread which wants to apply a read lock to the read-write lock can use either <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_rdlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_rdlock</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock</i>()</a>. If <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_rdlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_rdlock</i>()</a> is used, the thread acquires a read lock if a writer
does not hold the write lock and there are no writers blocked on the write lock. If a read lock is not acquired, the calling thread
blocks until it can acquire a lock. However, if <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock</i>()</a> is used, the function returns immediately with
the error [EBUSY] if any thread holds a write lock or there are blocked writers waiting for the write lock.</p>
<p class="tent">A thread which wants to apply a write lock to the read-write lock can use either of two functions: <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_wrlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_trywrlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</i>()</a>. If <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_wrlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</i>()</a> is used, the thread acquires the write lock if no
other reader or writer threads hold the read-write lock. If the write lock is not acquired, the thread blocks until it can acquire
the write lock. However, if <a href="../functions/pthread_rwlock_trywrlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</i>()</a> is used, the
function returns immediately with the error [EBUSY] if any thread is holding either a read or a write lock.</p>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/pthread_rwlock_unlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>()</a> function is used to unlock
a read-write lock object held by the calling thread. Results are undefined if the read-write lock is not held by the calling

locked state but without the current thread as one of its owners. If this function releases the last read lock for this read-write
lock object, the read-write lock object is put in the unlocked read state. If this function is called to release a write lock for
this read-write lock object, the read-write lock object is put in the unlocked state.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Thread Concurrency Level
<p class="tent">On threads implementations that multiplex user threads onto a smaller set of kernel execution entities, the system
attempts to create a reasonable number of kernel execution entities for the application upon application startup.</p>
<p class="tent">On some implementations, these kernel entities are retained by user threads that block in the kernel. Other
implementations do not <i>timeslice</i> user threads so that multiple compute-bound user threads can share a kernel thread. On such
implementations, some applications may use up all the available kernel execution entities before their user-space threads are used
up. The process may be left with user threads capable of doing work for the application but with no way to schedule them.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Thread Stack Guard Size
<p class="tent">DCE threads introduced the concept of a &quot;thread stack guard size&quot;. Most thread implementations add a region of
protected memory to a thread's stack, commonly known as a &quot;guard region&quot;, as a safety measure to prevent stack pointer overflow
in one thread from corrupting the contents of another thread's stack. The default size of the guard regions attribute is {PAGESIZE}
bytes and is implementation-defined.</p>
<p class="tent">Some application developers may wish to change the stack guard size. When an application creates a large number of
threads, the extra page allocated for each stack may strain system resources. In addition to the extra page of memory, the kernel's
memory manager has to keep track of the different protections on adjoining pages. When this is a problem, the application developer
may request a guard size of 0 bytes to conserve system resources by eliminating stack overflow protection.</p>
<p class="tent">Conversely an application that allocates large data structures such as arrays on the stack may wish to increase the
default guard size in order to detect stack overflow. If a thread allocates two pages for a data array, a single guard page
provides little protection against thread stack overflows since the thread can corrupt adjoining memory beyond the guard page.</p>
<p class="tent">The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 defines a new attribute of a thread attributes object; that is, the
<i>guardsize</i> attribute which allows applications to specify the size of the guard region of a thread's stack.</p>
<p class="tent">Two functions are provided for manipulating a thread's stack guard size. The <a href=
"../functions/pthread_attr_setguardsize.html"><i>pthread_attr_setguardsize</i>()</a> function sets the thread <i>guardsize</i>
attribute, and the <a href="../functions/pthread_attr_getguardsize.html"><i>pthread_attr_getguardsize</i>()</a> function retrieves
the current value.</p>
<p class="tent">An implementation may round up the requested guard size to a multiple of the configurable system variable
{PAGESIZE}. In this case, <a href="../functions/pthread_attr_getguardsize.html"><i>pthread_attr_getguardsize</i>()</a> returns the
guard size specified by the previous <a href="../functions/pthread_attr_setguardsize.html"><i>pthread_attr_setguardsize</i>()</a>
function call and not the rounded up value.</p>
<p class="tent">If an application is managing its own thread stacks using the <i>stackaddr</i> attribute, the <i>guardsize</i>
attribute is ignored and no stack overflow protection is provided. In this case, it is the responsibility of the application to
manage stack overflow along with stack allocation.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Parallel I/O
<p class="tent">Suppose two or more threads independently issue read requests on the same file. To read specific data from a file,
a thread must first call <a href="../functions/lseek.html"><i>lseek</i>()</a> to seek to the proper offset in the file, and then
call <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> to retrieve the required data. If more than one thread does this at the
same time, the first thread may complete its seek call, but before it gets a chance to issue its read call a second thread may
complete its seek call, resulting in the first thread accessing incorrect data when it issues its read call. One workaround is to
lock the file descriptor while seeking and reading or writing, but this reduces parallelism and adds overhead.</p>
<p class="tent">Instead, the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 provides two functions to make seek/read and seek/write
operations atomic. The file descriptor's current offset is unchanged, thus allowing multiple read and write operations to proceed
in parallel. This improves the I/O performance of threaded applications. The <a href="../functions/pread.html"><i>pread</i>()</a>
function is used to do an atomic read of data from a file into a buffer. Conversely, the <a href=
"../functions/pwrite.html"><i>pwrite</i>()</a> function does an atomic write of data from a buffer to a file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_09_09" id="tag_22_02_09_09"></a>B.2.9.1 Thread-Safety</h5>
<p class="tent">All functions required by POSIX.1-2024 need to be thread-safe. Implementations have to provide internal
synchronization when necessary in order to achieve this goal. In certain casesâfor example, most floating-point
implementationsâcontext switch code may have to manage the writable shared state.</p>
<p class="tent">While a read from a pipe of {PIPE_BUF}*2 bytes may not generate a single atomic and thread-safe stream of bytes, it
should generate &quot;several&quot; (individually atomic) thread-safe streams of bytes. Similarly, while reading from a terminal device may
not generate a single atomic and thread-safe stream of bytes, it should generate some finite number of (individually atomic) and
thread-safe streams of bytes. That is, concurrent calls to read for a pipe, FIFO, or terminal device are not allowed to result in
corrupting the stream of bytes or other internal data. However, <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, in these cases,
is not required to return a single contiguous and atomic stream of bytes.</p>
<p class="tent">It is not required that all functions provided by POSIX.1-2024 be either async-cancel-safe or
async-signal-safe.</p>
<p class="tent">As it turns out, some functions are inherently not thread-safe; that is, their interface specifications preclude
thread-safety. For example, some functions (such as <a href="../functions/asctime.html"><i>asctime</i>()</a>) return a pointer to a
result stored in memory space allocated by the function on a per-process basis. Such a function is not thread-safe, because its
result can be overwritten by successive invocations. Other functions, while not inherently non-thread-safe, may be implemented in
ways that lead to them not being thread-safe. For example, some functions (such as <a href=
"../functions/rand.html"><i>rand</i>()</a>) store state information (such as a seed value, which survives multiple function
invocations) in memory space allocated by the function on a per-process basis. The implementation of such a function is not
thread-safe if the implementation fails to synchronize invocations of the function and thus fails to protect the state information.
The problem is that when the state information is not protected, concurrent invocations can interfere with one another (for
example, applications using <a href="../functions/rand.html"><i>rand</i>()</a> may see the same seed value).</p>
<p class="tent"><i>Thread-Safety and Locking of Existing Functions</i></p>
<p class="tent">Originally, POSIX.1 was not designed to work in a multi-threaded environment, and some implementations of some
existing functions will not work properly when executed concurrently. To provide routines that will work correctly in an
environment with threads (&quot;thread-safe&quot;), two problems need to be solved:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">Routines that maintain or return pointers to static areas internal to the routine (which may now be shared) need
to be modified. The routines <a href="../functions/ttyname.html"><i>ttyname</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/localtime.html"><i>localtime</i>()</a> are examples.</li>
<li class="tent">Routines that access data space shared by more than one thread need to be modified. The <a href=
"../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> function and the <i>stdio</i> family routines are examples.</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">There are a variety of constraints on these changes. The first is compatibility with the existing versions of these
functionsânon-thread-safe functions will continue to be in use for some time, as the original interfaces are used by existing code.
Another is that the new thread-safe versions of these functions represent as small a change as possible over the familiar
interfaces provided by the existing non-thread-safe versions. The new interfaces should be independent of any particular threads
implementation. In particular, they should be thread-safe without depending on explicit thread-specific memory. Finally, there
should be minimal performance penalty due to the changes made to the functions.</p>
<p class="tent">It is intended that the list of functions from POSIX.1 that cannot be made thread-safe and for which corrected
versions are provided be complete.</p>
<p class="tent"><i>Thread-Safety and Locking Solutions</i></p>
<p class="tent">Many of the POSIX.1 functions were thread-safe and did not change at all. However, some functions (for example, the
math functions typically found in <b>libm</b>) are not thread-safe because of writable shared global state. For instance, in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;754-1985 floating-point implementations, the computation modes and flags are global and shared.</p>
<p class="tent">Some functions are not thread-safe because a particular implementation is not reentrant, typically because of a
non-essential use of static storage. These require only a new implementation.</p>
<p class="tent">Thread-safe libraries are useful in a wide range of parallel (and asynchronous) programming environments, not just
within pthreads. In order to be used outside the context of pthreads, however, such libraries still have to use some
synchronization method. These could either be independent of the pthread synchronization operations, or they could be a subset of
the pthread interfaces. Either method results in thread-safe library implementations that can be used without the rest of
pthreads.</p>
<p class="tent">Some functions, such as the <i>stdio</i> family interface and dynamic memory allocation functions such as <a href=
"../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a>, are inter-dependent routines that share resources (for example, buffers) across
related calls. These require synchronization to work correctly, but they do not require any change to their external (user-visible)
interfaces.</p>
<p class="tent">In some cases, such as <a href="../functions/getc.html"><i>getc</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/putc.html"><i>putc</i>()</a>, adding synchronization is likely to create an unacceptable performance impact. In this
case, slower thread-safe synchronized functions are to be provided, but the original, faster (but unsafe) functions (which may be
implemented as macros) are retained under new names. Some additional special-purpose synchronization facilities are necessary for
these macros to be usable in multi-threaded programs. This also requires changes in <a href=
"../basedefs/stdio.h.html"><i>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</i></a>.</p>
<p class="tent">The other common reason that functions are unsafe is that they return a pointer to static storage, making the
functions non-thread-safe. This has to be changed, and there are three natural choices:</p>
<ol>
<li class="tent">Return a pointer to thread-specific storage
<p class="tent">This could incur a severe performance penalty on those architectures with a costly implementation of the
thread-specific data interface.</p>
<p class="tent">A variation on this technique is to use <a href="../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> to allocate storage
for the function output and return a pointer to this storage. This technique may also have an undesirable performance impact,
however, and a simplistic implementation requires that the user program explicitly free the storage object when it is no longer
needed. This technique is used by some existing POSIX.1 functions. With careful implementation for infrequently used functions,
there may be little or no performance or storage penalty, and the maintenance of already-standardized interfaces is a significant
benefit.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Return the actual value computed by the function
<p class="tent">This technique can only be used with functions that return pointers to structuresâroutines that return character
strings would have to wrap their output in an enclosing structure in order to return the output on the stack. There is also a
negative performance impact inherent in this solution in that the output value has to be copied twice before it can be used by the
calling function: once from the called routine's local buffers to the top of the stack, then from the top of the stack to the
assignment target. Finally, many older compilers cannot support this technique due to a historical tendency to use internal static
buffers to deliver the results of structure-valued functions.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Have the caller pass the address of a buffer to contain the computed value
<p class="tent">The only disadvantage of this approach is that extra arguments have to be provided by the calling program. It
represents the most efficient solution to the problem, however, and, unlike the <a href=
"../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> technique, it is semantically clear.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="tent">There are some routines (often groups of related routines) whose interfaces are inherently non-thread-safe because
they communicate across multiple function invocations by means of static memory locations. The solution is to redesign the calls so
that they are thread-safe, typically by passing the needed data as extra parameters. Unfortunately, this may require major changes
to the interface as well.</p>
<p class="tent">A floating-point implementation using IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;754-1985 is a case in point. A less problematic example is
the <i>rand48</i> family of pseudo-random number generators. The functions <a href=
"../functions/getgrgid.html"><i>getgrgid</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getgrnam.html"><i>getgrnam</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getpwnam.html"><i>getpwnam</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/getpwuid.html"><i>getpwuid</i>()</a> are another such
case.</p>
<p class="tent">The problems with <i>errno</i> are discussed in <a href="#tag_22_02_03_01">Alternative Solutions for Per-Thread
errno</a>.</p>
<p class="tent">Some functions can be thread-safe or not, depending on their arguments. These include the <a href=
"../functions/tmpnam.html"><i>tmpnam</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/ctermid.html"><i>ctermid</i>()</a> functions. These
functions have pointers to character strings as arguments. If the pointers are not NULL, the functions store their results in the
character string; however, if the pointers are NULL, the functions store their results in an area that may be static and thus
subject to overwriting by successive calls. These should only be called by multi-thread applications when their arguments are
non-NULL.</p>
<p class="tent"><i>Asynchronous Safety and Thread-Safety</i></p>
<p class="tent">A floating-point implementation has many modes that effect rounding and other aspects of computation. Functions in
some math library implementations may change the computation modes for the duration of a function call. If such a function call is
interrupted by a signal or cancellation, the floating-point state is not required to be protected.</p>
<p class="tent">There is a significant cost to make floating-point operations async-cancel-safe or async-signal-safe; accordingly,
neither form of async safety is required.</p>
<p class="tent"><i>Functions Returning Pointers to Static Storage</i></p>
<p class="tent">For those functions that are not thread-safe because they return values in fixed size statically allocated
structures, alternate &quot;_r&quot; forms are provided that pass a pointer to an explicit result structure. Those that return pointers
into library-allocated buffers have forms provided with explicit buffer and length parameters.</p>
<p class="tent">For functions that return pointers to library-allocated buffers, it makes sense to provide &quot;_r&quot; versions that
allow the application control over allocation of the storage in which results are returned. This allows the state used by these
functions to be managed on an application-specific basis, supporting per-thread, per-process, or other application-specific sharing
relationships.</p>
<p class="tent">Early proposals had provided &quot;_r&quot; versions for functions that returned pointers to variable-size buffers without
providing a means for determining the required buffer size. This would have made using such functions exceedingly clumsy,
potentially requiring iteratively calling them with increasingly larger guesses for the amount of storage required. Hence, <a href=
"../functions/sysconf.html"><i>sysconf</i>()</a> variables have been provided for such functions that return the maximum required
buffer size.</p>
<p class="tent">Thus, the rule that has been followed by POSIX.1-2024 when adapting single-threaded non-thread-safe functions is as
follows: all functions returning pointers to library-allocated storage should have &quot;_r&quot; versions provided, allowing the
application control over the storage allocation. Those with variable-sized return values accept both a buffer address and a length
parameter. The <a href="../functions/sysconf.html"><i>sysconf</i>()</a> variables are provided to supply the appropriate buffer
sizes when required. Implementors are encouraged to apply the same rule when adapting their own existing functions to a pthreads
environment.</p>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_09_10" id="tag_22_02_09_10"></a>B.2.9.2 Thread IDs</h5>
<p class="tent">Separate applications should communicate through well-defined interfaces and should not depend on each other's
implementation. For example, if a programmer decides to rewrite the <a href="../utilities/sort.html"><i>sort</i></a> utility using
multiple threads, it should be easy to do this so that the interface to the <a href="../utilities/sort.html"><i>sort</i></a>
utility does not change. Consider that if the user causes SIGINT to be generated while the <a href=
"../utilities/sort.html"><i>sort</i></a> utility is running, keeping the same interface means that the entire <a href=
"../utilities/sort.html"><i>sort</i></a> utility is killed, not just one of its threads. As another example, consider a realtime
application that manages a reactor. Such an application may wish to allow other applications to control the priority at which it
watches the control rods. One technique to accomplish this is to write the ID of the thread watching the control rods into a file
and allow other programs to change the priority of that thread as they see fit. A simpler technique is to have the reactor process
accept IPCs (Interprocess Communication messages) from other processes, telling it at a semantic level what priority the program
should assign to watching the control rods. This allows the programmer greater flexibility in the implementation. For example, the
programmer can change the implementation from having one thread per rod to having one thread watching all of the rods without
changing the interface. Having threads live inside the process means that the implementation of a process is invisible to outside
processes (excepting debuggers and system management tools).</p>
<p class="tent">Threads do not provide a protection boundary. Every thread model allows threads to share memory with other threads
and encourages this sharing to be widespread. This means that one thread can wipe out memory that is needed for the correct
functioning of other threads that are sharing its memory. Consequently, providing each thread with its own user and/or group IDs
would not provide a protection boundary between threads sharing memory.</p>
<p class="tent">Some applications make the assumption that the implementation can always detect invalid uses of thread IDs of type
<b>pthread_t</b>. This is an invalid assumption. Specifically, if <b>pthread_t</b> is defined as a pointer type, no access check
needs to be performed before using the ID.</p>
<p class="tent">As with other interfaces that take pointer parameters, the outcome of passing an invalid parameter can result in an
invalid memory reference or an attempt to access an undefined portion of a memory object, cause signals to be sent (SIGSEGV or
SIGBUS) and possible termination of the process. This is a similar case to passing an invalid buffer pointer to <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>. Some implementations might implement <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>
as a system call and set an [EFAULT] error condition. Other implementations might contain parts of <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> at user level and the first attempt to access data at an invalid reference will cause a
signal to be sent instead.</p>
<p class="tent">If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of its lifetime, it is recommended that the function
should fail and report an [ESRCH] error. This does not imply that implementations are required to return in this case. It is
legitimate behavior to send an &quot;invalid memory reference&quot; signal (SIGSEGV or SIGBUS). It is the application's responsibility to

<ul>
<li class="tent">Scheduling Implementation Models
<p class="tent">The following scheduling implementation models are presented in terms of threads and &quot;kernel entities&quot;. This is
to simplify exposition of the models, and it does not imply that an implementation actually has an identifiable &quot;kernel
entity&quot;.</p>
<p class="tent">A kernel entity is not defined beyond the fact that it has scheduling attributes that are used to resolve
contention with other kernel entities for execution resources. A kernel entity may be thought of as an envelope that holds a thread
or a separate kernel thread. It is not a conventional process, although it shares with the process the attribute that it has a
single thread of control; it does not necessarily imply an address space, open files, and so on. It is better thought of as a
primitive facility upon which conventional processes and threads may be constructed.</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">System Thread Scheduling Model
<p class="tent">This model consists of one thread per kernel entity. The kernel entity is solely responsible for scheduling thread
execution on one or more processors. This model schedules all threads against all other threads in the system using the scheduling
attributes of the thread.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Process Scheduling Model
<p class="tent">A generalized process scheduling model consists of two levels of scheduling. A threads library creates a pool of
kernel entities, as required, and schedules threads to run on them using the scheduling attributes of the threads. Typically, the
size of the pool is a function of the simultaneously runnable threads, not the total number of threads. The kernel then schedules
the kernel entities onto processors according to their scheduling attributes, which are managed by the threads library. This set
model potentially allows a wide range of mappings between threads and kernel entities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="tent">System and Process Scheduling Model Performance
<p class="tent">There are a number of important implications on the performance of applications using these scheduling models. The
process scheduling model potentially provides lower overhead for making scheduling decisions, since there is no need to access
kernel-level information or functions and the set of schedulable entities is smaller (only the threads within the process).</p>
<p class="tent">On the other hand, since the kernel is also making scheduling decisions regarding the system resources under its
control (for example, CPU(s), I/O devices, memory), decisions that do not take thread scheduling parameters into account can result
in unspecified delays for realtime application threads, causing them to miss maximum response time limits.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Rate Monotonic Scheduling
<p class="tent">Rate monotonic scheduling was considered, but rejected for standardization in the context of pthreads. A sporadic
server policy is included.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Scheduling Options
<p class="tent">In POSIX.1-2024, the basic thread scheduling functions are defined under the threads functionality, so that they
are required of all threads implementations. However, there are no specific scheduling policies required by this functionality to
allow for conforming thread implementations that are not targeted to realtime applications.</p>
<p class="tent">Specific standard scheduling policies are defined to be under the Thread Execution Scheduling option, and they are
specifically designed to support realtime applications by providing predictable resource-sharing sequences. The name of this option
was chosen to emphasize that this functionality is defined as appropriate for realtime applications that require simple
priority-based scheduling.</p>
<p class="tent">It is recognized that these policies are not necessarily satisfactory for some multi-processor implementations, and
work is ongoing to address a wider range of scheduling behaviors. The interfaces have been chosen to create abundant opportunity
for future scheduling policies to be implemented and standardized based on this interface. In order to standardize a new scheduling
policy, all that is required (from the standpoint of thread scheduling attributes) is to define a new policy name, new members of
the thread attributes object, and functions to set these members when the scheduling policy is equal to the new value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_13" id="tag_22_02_09_13"></a>Scheduling Contention Scope</h5>
<p class="tent">In order to accommodate the requirement for realtime response, each thread has a scheduling contention scope
attribute. Threads with a system scheduling contention scope have to be scheduled with respect to all other threads in the system.
These threads are usually bound to a single kernel entity that reflects their scheduling attributes and are directly scheduled by
the kernel.</p>
<p class="tent">Threads with a process scheduling contention scope need be scheduled only with respect to the other threads in the
process. These threads may be scheduled within the process onto a pool of kernel entities. The implementation is also free to bind
these threads directly to kernel entities and let them be scheduled by the kernel. Process scheduling contention scope allows the
implementation the most flexibility and is the default if both contention scopes are supported and none is specified.</p>
<p class="tent">Thus, the choice by implementors to provide one or the other (or both) of these scheduling models is driven by the
need of their supported application domains for worst-case (that is, realtime) response, or average-case (non-realtime)
response.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_14" id="tag_22_02_09_14"></a>Scheduling Allocation Domain</h5>
<p class="tent">The SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR scheduling policies take on different characteristics on a multi-processor. Other
scheduling policies are also subject to changed behavior when executed on a multi-processor. The concept of scheduling allocation
domain determines the set of processors on which the threads of an application may run. By considering the application's processor
scheduling allocation domain for its threads, scheduling policies can be defined in terms of their behavior for varying processor
scheduling allocation domain values. It is conceivable that not all scheduling allocation domain sizes make sense for all
scheduling policies on all implementations. The concept of scheduling allocation domain, however, is a useful tool for the
description of multi-processor scheduling policies.</p>
<p class="tent">The &quot;process control&quot; approach to scheduling obtains significant performance advantages from dynamic scheduling
allocation domain sizes when it is applicable.</p>
<p class="tent">Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) multi-processors may use a system scheduling structure that involves reassignment
of threads among scheduling allocation domains. In NUMA machines, a natural model of scheduling is to match scheduling allocation
domains to clusters of processors. Load balancing in such an environment requires changing the scheduling allocation domain to
which a thread is assigned.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_15" id="tag_22_02_09_15"></a>Scheduling Documentation</h5>
<p class="tent">Implementation-provided scheduling policies need to be completely documented in order to be useful. This
documentation includes a description of the attributes required for the policy, the scheduling interaction of threads running under
this policy and all other supported policies, and the effects of all possible values for processor scheduling allocation domain.
Note that for the implementor wishing to be minimally-compliant, it is (minimally) acceptable to define the behavior as
undefined.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_16" id="tag_22_02_09_16"></a>Scheduling Contention Scope Attribute</h5>
<p class="tent">The scheduling contention scope defines how threads compete for resources. Within POSIX.1-2024, scheduling
contention scope is used to describe only how threads are scheduled in relation to one another in the system. That is, either they
are scheduled against all other threads in the system (&quot;system scope&quot;) or only against those threads in the process (&quot;process
scope&quot;). In fact, scheduling contention scope may apply to additional resources, including virtual timers and profiling, which are
not currently considered by POSIX.1-2024.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_17" id="tag_22_02_09_17"></a>Mixed Scopes</h5>
<p class="tent">If only one scheduling contention scope is supported, the scheduling decision is straightforward. To perform the
processor scheduling decision in a mixed scope environment, it is necessary to map the scheduling attributes of the thread with
process-wide contention scope to the same attribute space as the thread with system-wide contention scope.</p>
<p class="tent">Since a conforming implementation has to support one and may support both scopes, it is useful to discuss the
effects of such choices with respect to example applications. If an implementation supports both scopes, mixing scopes provides a
means of better managing system-level (that is, kernel-level) and library-level resources. In general, threads with system scope
will require the resources of a separate kernel entity in order to guarantee the scheduling semantics. On the other hand, threads
with process scope can share the resources of a kernel entity while maintaining the scheduling semantics.</p>
<p class="tent">The application is free to create threads with dedicated kernel resources, and other threads that multiplex kernel
resources. Consider the example of a window server. The server allocates two threads per widget: one thread manages the widget user
interface (including drawing), while the other thread takes any required application action. This allows the widget to be
&quot;active&quot; while the application is computing. A screen image may be built from thousands of widgets. If each of these threads had
been created with system scope, then most of the kernel-level resources might be wasted, since only a few widgets are active at any
one time. In addition, mixed scope is particularly useful in a window server where one thread with high priority and system scope
handles the mouse so that it tracks well. As another example, consider a database server. For each of the hundreds or thousands of
clients supported by a large server, an equivalent number of threads will have to be created. If each of these threads were system
scope, the consequences would be the same as for the window server example above. However, the server could be constructed so that
actual retrieval of data is done by several dedicated threads. Dedicated threads that do work for all clients frequently justify
the added expense of system scope. If it were not permissible to mix system and process threads in the same process, this type of
solution would not be possible.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_18" id="tag_22_02_09_18"></a>Dynamic Thread Scheduling Parameters Access</h5>
<p class="tent">In many time-constrained applications, there is no need to change the scheduling attributes dynamically during
thread or process execution, since the general use of these attributes is to reflect directly the time constraints of the
application. Since these time constraints are generally imposed to meet higher-level system requirements, such as accuracy or
availability, they frequently should remain unchanged during application execution.</p>
<p class="tent">However, there are important situations in which the scheduling attributes should be changed. Generally, this will
occur when external environmental conditions exist in which the time constraints change. Consider, for example, a space vehicle
major mode change, such as the change from ascent to descent mode, or the change from the space environment to the atmospheric
environment. In such cases, the frequency with which many of the sensors or actuators need to be read or written will change, which
will necessitate a priority change. In other cases, even the existence of a time constraint might be temporary, necessitating not
just a priority change, but also a policy change for ongoing threads or processes. For this reason, it is critical that the
interface should provide functions to change the scheduling parameters dynamically, but, as with many of the other realtime
functions, it is important that applications use them properly to avoid the possibility of unnecessarily degrading performance.</p>
<p class="tent">In providing functions for dynamically changing the scheduling behavior of threads, there were two options: provide
functions to get and set the individual scheduling parameters of threads, or provide a single interface to get and set all the
scheduling parameters for a given thread simultaneously. Both approaches have merit. Access functions for individual parameters
allow simpler control of thread scheduling for simple thread scheduling parameters. However, a single function for setting all the
parameters for a given scheduling policy is required when first setting that scheduling policy. Since the single all-encompassing
functions are required, it was decided to leave the interface as minimal as possible. Note that simpler functions (such as
<i>pthread_setprio</i>() for threads running under the priority-based schedulers) can be easily defined in terms of the
all-encompassing functions.</p>
<p class="tent">If the <a href="../functions/pthread_setschedparam.html"><i>pthread_setschedparam</i>()</a> function executes
successfully, it will have set all of the scheduling parameter values indicated in <i>param</i>; otherwise, none of the scheduling
parameters will have been modified. This is necessary to ensure that the scheduling of this and all other threads continues to be
consistent in the presence of an erroneous scheduling parameter.</p>
<p class="tent">The [EPERM] error value is included in the list of possible <a href=
"../functions/pthread_setschedparam.html"><i>pthread_setschedparam</i>()</a> error returns as a reflection of the fact that the
ability to change scheduling parameters increases risks to the implementation and application performance if the scheduling
parameters are changed improperly. For this reason, and based on some existing practice, it was felt that some implementations
would probably choose to define specific permissions for changing either a thread's own or another thread's scheduling parameters.
POSIX.1-2024 does not include portable methods for setting or retrieving permissions, so any such use of permissions is completely
unspecified.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_19" id="tag_22_02_09_19"></a>Mutex Initialization Scheduling Attributes</h5>
<p class="tent">In a priority-driven environment, a direct use of traditional primitives like mutexes and condition variables can
lead to unbounded priority inversion, where a higher priority thread can be blocked by a lower priority thread, or set of threads,
for an unbounded duration of time. As a result, it becomes impossible to guarantee thread deadlines. Priority inversion can be
bounded and minimized by the use of priority inheritance protocols. This allows thread deadlines to be guaranteed even in the
presence of synchronization requirements.</p>
<p class="tent">Two useful but simple members of the family of priority inheritance protocols are the basic priority inheritance
protocol and the priority ceiling protocol emulation. Under the Basic Priority Inheritance protocol (governed by the Non-Robust
Mutex Priority Inheritance option), a thread that is blocking higher priority threads executes at the priority of the highest
priority thread that it blocks. This simple mechanism allows priority inversion to be bounded by the duration of critical sections
and makes timing analysis possible.</p>
<p class="tent">Under the Priority Ceiling Protocol Emulation protocol (governed by the Thread Priority Protection option), each
mutex has a priority ceiling, usually defined as the priority of the highest priority thread that can lock the mutex. When a thread
is executing inside critical sections, its priority is unconditionally increased to the highest of the priority ceilings of all the
mutexes owned by the thread. This protocol has two very desirable properties in uni-processor systems. First, a thread can be
blocked by a lower priority thread for at most the duration of one single critical section. Furthermore, when the protocol is
correctly used in a single processor, and if threads do not become blocked while owning mutexes, mutual deadlocks are
prevented.</p>
<p class="tent">The priority ceiling emulation can be extended to multiple processor environments, in which case the values of the
priority ceilings will be assigned depending on the kind of mutex that is being used: local to only one processor, or global,
shared by several processors. Local priority ceilings will be assigned the usual way, equal to the priority of the highest priority
thread that may lock that mutex. Global priority ceilings will usually be assigned a priority level higher than all the priorities
assigned to any of the threads that reside in the involved processors to avoid the effect called remote blocking.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_20" id="tag_22_02_09_20"></a>Change the Priority Ceiling of a Mutex</h5>
<p class="tent">In order for the priority protect protocol to exhibit its desired properties of bounding priority inversion and
avoidance of deadlock, it is critical that the ceiling priority of a mutex be the same as the priority of the highest thread that
can ever hold it, or higher. Thus, if the priorities of the threads using such mutexes never change dynamically, there is no need
ever to change the priority ceiling of a mutex.</p>
<p class="tent">However, if a major system mode change results in an altered response time requirement for one or more application
threads, their priority has to change to reflect it. It will occasionally be the case that the priority ceilings of mutexes held
also need to change. While changing priority ceilings should generally be avoided, it is important that POSIX.1-2024 provide these
interfaces for those cases in which it is necessary.</p>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_09_21" id="tag_22_02_09_21"></a>B.2.9.5 Thread Cancellation</h5>
<p class="tent">Many existing threads packages have facilities for canceling an operation or canceling a thread. These facilities
are used for implementing user requests (such as the CANCEL button in a window-based application), for implementing OR parallelism
(for example, telling the other threads to stop working once one thread has found a forced mate in a parallel chess program), or
for implementing the ABORT mechanism in Ada.</p>
<p class="tent">POSIX programs traditionally have used the signal mechanism combined with either <a href=
"../functions/longjmp.html"><i>longjmp</i>()</a> or polling to cancel operations. Many POSIX programmers have trouble using these
facilities to solve their problems efficiently in a single-threaded process. With the introduction of threads, these solutions
become even more difficult to use.</p>
<p class="tent">The main issues with implementing a cancellation facility are specifying the operation to be canceled, cleanly
releasing any resources allocated to that operation, controlling when the target notices that it has been canceled, and defining
the interaction between asynchronous signals and cancellation.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_22" id="tag_22_02_09_22"></a>Specifying the Operation to Cancel</h5>
<p class="tent">Consider a thread that calls through five distinct levels of program abstraction and then, inside the lowest-level
abstraction, calls a function that suspends the thread. (An abstraction boundary is a layer at which the client of the abstraction
sees only the service being provided and can remain ignorant of the implementation. Abstractions are often layered, each level of
abstraction being a client of the lower-level abstraction and implementing a higher-level abstraction.) Depending on the semantics
of each abstraction, one could imagine wanting to cancel only the call that causes suspension, only the bottom two levels, or the
operation being done by the entire thread. Canceling operations at a finer grain than the entire thread is difficult because
threads are active and they may be run in parallel on a multi-processor. By the time one thread can make a request to cancel an
operation, the thread performing the operation may have completed that operation and gone on to start another operation whose
cancellation is not desired. Thread IDs are not reused until the thread has exited, and either it was created with the <i>Attr
detachstate</i> attribute set to PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED or the <a href="../functions/pthread_join.html"><i>pthread_join</i>()</a>
or <a href="../functions/pthread_detach.html"><i>pthread_detach</i>()</a> function has been called for that thread. Consequently, a
thread cancellation will never be misdirected when the thread terminates. For these reasons, the canceling of operations is done at
the granularity of the thread. Threads are designed to be inexpensive enough so that a separate thread may be created to perform
each separately cancelable operation; for example, each possibly long running user request.</p>
<p class="tent">For cancellation to be used in existing code, cancellation scopes and handlers will have to be established for code
that needs to release resources upon cancellation, so that it follows the programming discipline described in the text.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_23" id="tag_22_02_09_23"></a>A Special Signal Versus a Special Interface</h5>
<p class="tent">Two different mechanisms were considered for providing the cancellation interfaces. The first was to provide an
interface to direct signals at a thread and then to define a special signal that had the required semantics. The other alternative
was to use a special interface that delivered the correct semantics to the target thread.</p>
<p class="tent">The solution using signals produced a number of problems. It required the implementation to provide cancellation in
terms of signals whereas a perfectly valid (and possibly more efficient) implementation could have both layered on a low-level set
of primitives. There were so many exceptions to the special signal (it cannot be used with <a href=
"../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a>, no POSIX.1 interfaces can be used with it) that it was clearly not a valid signal. Its
semantics on delivery were also completely different from any existing POSIX.1 signal. As such, a special interface that did not
mandate the implementation and did not confuse the semantics of signals and cancellation was felt to be the better solution.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_24" id="tag_22_02_09_24"></a>Races Between Cancellation and Resuming Execution</h5>
<p class="tent">Due to the nature of cancellation, there is generally no synchronization between the thread requesting the
cancellation of a blocked thread and events that may cause that thread to resume execution. For this reason, and because excess
serialization hurts performance, when both an event that a thread is waiting for has occurred and a cancellation request has been
made and cancellation is enabled, POSIX.1-2024 explicitly allows the implementation to choose between returning from the blocking
call or acting on the cancellation request.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_25" id="tag_22_02_09_25"></a>Interaction of Cancellation with Asynchronous Signals</h5>
<p class="tent">A typical use of cancellation is to acquire a lock on some resource and to establish a cancellation cleanup handler
for releasing the resource when and if the thread is canceled.</p>
<p class="tent">A correct and complete implementation of cancellation in the presence of asynchronous signals requires considerable
care. An implementation has to push a cancellation cleanup handler on the cancellation cleanup stack while maintaining the
integrity of the stack data structure. If an asynchronously-generated signal is posted to the thread during a stack operation, the
signal handler cannot manipulate the cancellation cleanup stack. As a consequence, asynchronous signal handlers may not cancel
threads or otherwise manipulate the cancellation state of a thread. Threads may, of course, be canceled by another thread that used
a <a href="../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> function to wait synchronously for an asynchronous signal.</p>
<p class="tent">In order for cancellation to function correctly, it is required that asynchronous signal handlers not change the
cancellation state. This requires that some elements of existing practice, such as using <a href=
"../functions/longjmp.html"><i>longjmp</i>()</a> to exit from an asynchronous signal handler implicitly, be prohibited in cases
where the integrity of the cancellation state of the interrupt thread cannot be ensured.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_26" id="tag_22_02_09_26"></a>Thread Cancellation Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Cancelability States
<p class="tent">The three possible cancelability states (disabled, deferred, and asynchronous) are encoded into two separate bits
((disable, enable) and (deferred, asynchronous)) to allow them to be changed and restored independently. For instance, short code
sequences that will not block sometimes disable cancelability on entry and restore the previous state upon exit. Likewise, long or
unbounded code sequences containing no convenient explicit cancellation points will sometimes set the cancelability type to
asynchronous on entry and restore the previous value upon exit.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Cancellation Points
<p class="tent">Cancellation points are points inside of certain functions where a thread has to act on any pending cancellation
request when cancelability is enabled. For functions in the &quot;shall occur&quot; list, a cancellation check must be performed on every
call regardless of whether, absent the cancellation, the call would have blocked. For functions in the &quot;may occur&quot; list, a
cancellation check may be performed on some calls but not others; i.e., whether or not a cancellation point occurs when one of
these functions is being executed can depend on current conditions.</p>
<p class="tent">The idea was considered of allowing implementations to define whether blocking calls such as <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> should be cancellation points. It was decided that it would adversely affect the design
of conforming applications if blocking calls were not cancellation points because threads could be left blocked in an uncancelable
state.</p>
<p class="tent">There are several important blocking routines that are specifically not made cancellation points:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent"><a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a>
<p class="tent">If <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a> were a cancellation point, every
routine that called it would also become a cancellation point (that is, any routine that touched shared state would automatically
become a cancellation point). For example, <a href="../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/free.html"><i>free</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/rand.html"><i>rand</i>()</a> would become cancellation points
under this scheme. Having too many cancellation points makes programming very difficult, leading to either much disabling and
restoring of cancelability or much difficulty in trying to arrange for reliable cleanup at every possible place.</p>
<p class="tent">Since <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a> is not a cancellation point,
threads could result in being blocked uninterruptibly for long periods of time if mutexes were used as a general synchronization
mechanism. As this is normally not acceptable, mutexes should only be used to protect resources that are held for small fixed
lengths of time where not being able to be canceled will not be a problem. Resources that need to be held exclusively for long
periods of time should be protected with condition variables.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent"><a href="../functions/pthread_barrier_wait.html"><i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>()</a>
<p class="tent">Canceling a barrier wait will render a barrier unusable. Similar to a barrier timeout (which the standard
developers rejected), there is no way to guarantee the consistency of a barrier's internal data structures if a barrier wait is
canceled.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent"><a href="../functions/pthread_spin_lock.html"><i>pthread_spin_lock</i>()</a>
<p class="tent">As with mutexes, spin locks should only be used to protect resources that are held for small fixed lengths of time
where not being cancelable will not be a problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">Every library routine should specify whether or not it includes any cancellation points. Typically, only those
routines that may block or compute indefinitely need to include cancellation points.</p>
<p class="tent">Correctly coded routines only reach cancellation points after having set up a cancellation cleanup handler to
restore invariants if the thread is canceled at that point. Being cancelable only at specified cancellation points allows
programmers to keep track of actions needed in a cancellation cleanup handler more easily. A thread should only be made
asynchronously cancelable when it is not in the process of acquiring or releasing resources or otherwise in a state from which it
would be difficult or impossible to recover.</p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Thread Cancellation Cleanup Handlers
<p class="tent">The cancellation cleanup handlers provide a portable mechanism, easy to implement, for releasing resources and
restoring invariants. They are easier to use than signal handlers because they provide a stack of cancellation cleanup handlers
rather than a single handler, and because they have an argument that can be used to pass context information to the handler.</p>
<p class="tent">The alternative to providing these simple cancellation cleanup handlers (whose only use is for cleaning up when a
thread is canceled) is to define a general exception package that could be used for handling and cleaning up after hardware traps
and software-detected errors. This was too far removed from the charter of providing threads to handle asynchrony. However, it is
an explicit goal of POSIX.1-2024 to be compatible with existing exception facilities and languages having exceptions.</p>
<p class="tent">The interaction of this facility and other procedure-based or language-level exception facilities is unspecified in
this version of POSIX.1-2024. However, it is intended that it be possible for an implementation to define the relationship between
these cancellation cleanup handlers and Ada, C++, or other language-level exception handling facilities.</p>
<p class="tent">It was suggested that the cancellation cleanup handlers should also be called when the process exits or calls the
<i>exec</i> function. This was rejected partly due to the performance problem caused by having to call the cancellation cleanup
handlers of every thread before the operation could continue. The other reason was that the only state expected to be cleaned up by
the cancellation cleanup handlers would be the intraprocess state. Any handlers that are to clean up the interprocess state would
be registered with <a href="../functions/atexit.html"><i>atexit</i>()</a>. There is the orthogonal problem that the <i>exec</i>
functions do not honor the <a href="../functions/atexit.html"><i>atexit</i>()</a> handlers, but resolving this is beyond the scope
of POSIX.1-2024.<br></p>
</li>
<li class="tent">Async-Cancel Safety
<p class="tent">A function is said to be async-cancel-safe if it is written in such a way that entering the function with
asynchronous cancelability enabled will not cause any invariants to be violated, even if a cancellation request is delivered at any
arbitrary instruction. Functions that are async-cancel-safe are often written in such a way that they need to acquire no resources
for their operation and the visible variables that they may write are strictly limited.</p>
<p class="tent">Any routine that gets a resource as a side-effect cannot be made async-cancel-safe (for example, <a href=
"../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a>). If such a routine were called with asynchronous cancelability enabled, it might
acquire the resource successfully, but as it was returning to the client, it could act on a cancellation request. In such a case,
the application would have no way of knowing whether the resource was acquired or not.</p>
<p class="tent">Indeed, because many interesting routines cannot be made async-cancel-safe, most library routines in general are
not async-cancel-safe. Every library routine should specify whether or not it is async-cancel safe so that programmers know which
routines can be called from code that is asynchronously cancelable.</p>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_09_27" id="tag_22_02_09_27"></a>B.2.9.6 Thread Read-Write Locks</h5>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_28" id="tag_22_02_09_28"></a>Background</h5>
<p class="tent">Read-write locks are often used to allow parallel access to data on multi-processors, to avoid context switches on
uni-processors when multiple threads access the same data, and to protect data structures that are frequently accessed (that is,
read) but rarely updated (that is, written). The in-core representation of a file system directory is a good example of such a data
structure. One would like to achieve as much concurrency as possible when searching directories, but limit concurrent access when
adding or deleting files.</p>
<p class="tent">Although read-write locks can be implemented with mutexes and condition variables, such implementations are
significantly less efficient than is possible. Therefore, this synchronization primitive is included in POSIX.1-2024 for the
purpose of allowing more efficient implementations in multi-processor systems.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_29" id="tag_22_02_09_29"></a>Queuing of Waiting Threads</h5>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/pthread_rwlock_unlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>()</a> function description
states that one writer or one or more readers must acquire the lock if it is no longer held by any thread as a result of the call.
However, the function does not specify which thread(s) acquire the lock, unless the Thread Execution Scheduling option is
supported.</p>
<p class="tent">The standard developers considered the issue of scheduling with respect to the queuing of threads blocked on a
read-write lock. The question turned out to be whether POSIX.1-2024 should require priority scheduling of read-write locks for
threads whose execution scheduling policy is priority-based (for example, SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR). There are tradeoffs between
priority scheduling, the amount of concurrency achievable among readers, and the prevention of writer and/or reader starvation.</p>
<p class="tent">For example, suppose one or more readers hold a read-write lock and the following threads request the lock in the
listed order:</p>
<pre>
<tt>pthread_rwlock_wrlock() - Low priority thread writer_a
pthread_rwlock_rdlock() - High priority thread reader_a
pthread_rwlock_rdlock() - High priority thread reader_b
pthread_rwlock_rdlock() - High priority thread reader_c
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">When the lock becomes available, should <i>writer_a</i> block the high priority readers? Or, suppose a read-write
lock becomes available and the following are queued:</p>
<pre>
<tt>pthread_rwlock_rdlock() - Low priority thread reader_a
pthread_rwlock_rdlock() - Low priority thread reader_b
pthread_rwlock_rdlock() - Low priority thread reader_c
pthread_rwlock_wrlock() - Medium priority thread writer_a
pthread_rwlock_rdlock() - High priority thread reader_d
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">If priority scheduling is applied then <i>reader_d</i> would acquire the lock and <i>writer_a</i> would block the
remaining readers. But should the remaining readers also acquire the lock to increase concurrency? The solution adopted takes into
account that when the Thread Execution Scheduling option is supported, high priority threads may in fact starve low priority
threads (the application developer is responsible in this case for designing the system in such a way that this starvation is
avoided). Therefore, POSIX.1-2024 specifies that high priority readers take precedence over lower priority writers. However, to
prevent writer starvation from threads of the same or lower priority, writers take precedence over readers of the same or lower
priority.</p>
<p class="tent">Priority inheritance mechanisms are non-trivial in the context of read-write locks. When a high priority writer is
forced to wait for multiple readers, for example, it is not clear which subset of the readers should inherit the writer's priority.
Furthermore, the internal data structures that record the inheritance must be accessible to all readers, and this implies some sort
of serialization that could negate any gain in parallelism achieved through the use of multiple readers in the first place.
Finally, existing practice does not support the use of priority inheritance for read-write locks. Therefore, no specification of
priority inheritance or priority ceiling is attempted. If reliable priority-scheduled synchronization is absolutely required, it
can always be obtained through the use of mutexes.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_30" id="tag_22_02_09_30"></a>Comparison to fcntl() Locks</h5>
<p class="tent">The read-write locks and the <a href="../functions/fcntl.html"><i>fcntl</i>()</a> locks in POSIX.1-2024 share a
common goal: increasing concurrency among readers, thus increasing throughput and decreasing delay.</p>
<p class="tent">However, the read-write locks have two features not present in the <a href=
"../functions/fcntl.html"><i>fcntl</i>()</a> locks. First, under priority scheduling, read-write locks are granted in priority
order. Second, also under priority scheduling, writer starvation is prevented by giving writers preference over readers of equal or
lower priority.</p>
<p class="tent">Also, read-write locks can be used in systems lacking a file system, such as those conforming to the minimal
realtime system profile of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.13-1998.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_02_09_31" id="tag_22_02_09_31"></a>History of Resolution Issues</h5>
<p class="tent">Based upon some balloting objections, early drafts specified the behavior of threads waiting on a read-write lock
during the execution of a signal handler, as if the thread had not called the lock operation. However, this specified behavior
would require implementations to establish internal signal handlers even though this situation would be rare, or never happen for
many programs. This would introduce an unacceptable performance hit in comparison to the little additional functionality gained.
Therefore, the behavior of read-write locks and signals was reverted back to its previous mutex-like specification.</p>

<p class="tent">The type <b>socklen_t</b> was invented to cover the range of implementations seen in the field. The intent of
<b>socklen_t</b> is to be the type for all lengths that are naturally bounded in size; that is, that they are the length of a
buffer which cannot sensibly become of massive size: network addresses, host names, string representations of these, ancillary
data, control messages, and socket options are examples. Truly boundless sizes are represented by <b>size_t</b> as in <a href=

<p class="tent">All <b>socklen_t</b> types were originally (in BSD UNIX) of type <b>int</b>. During the development of
POSIX.1-2024, it was decided to change all buffer lengths to <b>size_t</b>, which appears at face value to make sense. When dual
mode 32/64-bit systems came along, this choice unnecessarily complicated system interfaces because <b>size_t</b> (with <b>long</b>)
was a different size under ILP32 and LP64 models. Reverting to <b>int</b> would have happened except that some implementations had
already shipped 64-bit-only interfaces. The compromise was a type which could be defined to be any size by the implementation:
<b>socklen_t</b>.</p>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_02_11_01" id="tag_22_02_11_01"></a>B.2.11.1 Defined Types</h5>
<p class="tent">The requirement that additional types defined in this section end in &quot;_t&quot; was prompted by the problem of name
space pollution. It is difficult to define a type (where that type is not one defined by POSIX.1-2024) in one header file and use
it in another without adding symbols to the name space of the program. To allow implementors to provide their own types, all
conforming applications are required to avoid symbols ending in &quot;_t&quot;, which permits the implementor to provide additional types.
Because a major use of types is in the definition of structure members, which can (and in many cases must) be added to the
structures defined in POSIX.1-2024, the need for additional types is compelling.</p>
<p class="tent">The types, such as <b>ushort</b> and <b>ulong</b>, which are in common usage, are not defined in POSIX.1-2024
(although <b>ushort_t</b> would be permitted as an extension). They can be added to <a href=
"../basedefs/sys_types.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i></a> using a feature test macro (see <a href="#tag_22_02_02_01">B.2.2.1
POSIX.1 Symbols</a>). A suggested symbol for these is _SYSIII. Similarly, the types like <b>u_short</b> would probably be best
controlled by _BSD.</p>
<p class="tent">Some of these symbols may appear in other headers; see <a href="#tag_22_02_02_05">B.2.2.2 The Name Space</a>.</p>
<dl compact>
<dd></dd>
<dt><b>dev_t</b></dt>
<dd>This type may be made large enough to accommodate host-locality considerations of networked systems.
<p class="tent">This type must be arithmetic. Earlier proposals allowed this to be non-arithmetic (such as a structure) and
provided a <i>samefile</i>() function for comparison.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>gid_t</b></dt>
<dd>Some implementations had separated <b>gid_t</b> from <b>uid_t</b> before POSIX.1 was completed. It would be difficult for them
to coalesce them when it was unnecessary. Additionally, it is quite possible that user IDs might be different from group IDs
because the user ID might wish to span a heterogeneous network, where the group ID might not.
<p class="tent">For current implementations, the cost of having a separate <b>gid_t</b> will be only lexical.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>mode_t</b></dt>
<dd>This type was chosen so that implementations could choose the appropriate integer type, and for compatibility with the
ISO&nbsp;C standard. 4.3 BSD uses <b>unsigned short</b> and the SVID uses <b>ushort</b>, which is the same. Historically, only the
low-order sixteen bits are significant.</dd>
<dt><b>nlink_t</b></dt>
<dd>This type was introduced in place of <b>short</b> for <i>st_nlink</i> (see the <a href=
"../basedefs/sys_stat.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</i></a> header) in response to an objection that <b>short</b> was too
small.</dd>
<dt><b>off_t</b></dt>
<dd>This type is used to represent a file offset or file size. On systems supporting large files, <b>off_t</b> is larger than 32
bits in at least one programming environment. Other programming environments may use different sizes for <b>off_t</b>, for
compatibility or other reasons.</dd>
<dt><b>pid_t</b></dt>
<dd>The inclusion of this symbol was controversial because it is tied to the issue of the representation of a process ID as a
number. From the point of view of a conforming application, process IDs should be &quot;magic cookies&quot;<a href=
"#tag_foot_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> that are produced by calls such as <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>, used by calls such as <a href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a> or
<a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a>, and not otherwise analyzed (except that the sign is used as a flag for certain
operations).
<p class="tent">The concept of a {PID_MAX} value interacted with this in early proposals. Treating process IDs as an opaque type
both removes the requirement for {PID_MAX} and allows systems to be more flexible in providing process IDs that span a large range
of values, or a small one.</p>
<p class="tent">Since the values in <b>uid_t</b>, <b>gid_t</b>, and <b>pid_t</b> will be numbers generally, and potentially both
large in magnitude and sparse, applications that are based on arrays of objects of this type are unlikely to be fully portable in
any case. Solutions that treat them as magic cookies will be portable.</p>
<p class="tent">{CHILD_MAX} precludes the possibility of a &quot;toy implementation&quot;, where there would only be one process.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>ssize_t</b></dt>
<dd>This is intended to be a signed analog of <b>size_t</b>. The wording is such that an implementation may either choose to use a
longer type or simply to use the signed version of the type that underlies <b>size_t</b>. All functions that return <b>ssize_t</b>
(<a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>) describe as
&quot;implementation-defined&quot; the result of an input exceeding {SSIZE_MAX}. It is recognized that some implementations might have
<b>int</b>s that are smaller than <b>size_t</b>. A conforming application would be constrained not to perform I/O in pieces larger
than {SSIZE_MAX}, but a conforming application using extensions would be able to use the full range if the implementation provided
an extended range, while still having a single type-compatible interface.
<p class="tent">The symbols <b>size_t</b> and <b>ssize_t</b> are also required in <a href=
"../basedefs/unistd.h.html"><i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i></a> to minimize the changes needed for calls to <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>. Implementors are reminded that
it must be possible to include both <a href="../basedefs/sys_types.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i></a> and <a href=
"../basedefs/unistd.h.html"><i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i></a> in the same program (in either order) without error.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>uid_t</b></dt>
<dd>Before the addition of this type, the data types used to represent these values varied throughout early proposals. The <a href=
"../basedefs/sys_stat.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</i></a> header defined these values as type <b>short</b>, the
<i>&lt;passwd.h&gt;</i> file (now <a href="../basedefs/pwd.h.html"><i>&lt;pwd.h&gt;</i></a> and <a href=
"../basedefs/grp.h.html"><i>&lt;grp.h&gt;</i></a>) used an <b>int</b>, and <a href="../functions/getuid.html"><i>getuid</i>()</a>
returned an <b>int</b>. In response to a strong objection to the inconsistent definitions, all the types were switched to
<b>uid_t</b>.
<p class="tent">In practice, those historical implementations that use varying types of this sort can typedef <b>uid_t</b> to
<b>short</b> with no serious consequences.</p>
<p class="tent">The problem associated with this change concerns object compatibility after structure size changes. Since most
implementations will define <b>uid_t</b> as a short, the only substantive change will be a reduction in the size of the
<b>passwd</b> structure. Consequently, implementations with an overriding concern for object compatibility can pad the structure
back to its current size. For that reason, this problem was not considered critical enough to warrant the addition of a separate
type to POSIX.1.</p>
<p class="tent">The types <b>uid_t</b> and <b>gid_t</b> are magic cookies. There is no {UID_MAX} defined by POSIX.1, and no
structure imposed on <b>uid_t</b> and <b>gid_t</b> other than that they be positive arithmetic types. (In fact, they could be
<b>unsigned char</b>.) There is no maximum or minimum specified for the number of distinct user or group IDs.</p>

<p class="tent">This section contains a list of options and interfaces removed in POSIX.1-2024, together with advice for
application developers on the alternative interfaces that should be used.</p>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_03_01_01" id="tag_22_03_01_01"></a>B.3.1.1 STREAMS Option</h5>
<p class="tent">Applications are recommended to use UNIX domain sockets as an alternative for much of the functionality provided by
this option. For example, file descriptor passing can be performed using <a href="../functions/sendmsg.html"><i>sendmsg</i>()</a>
and <a href="../functions/recvmsg.html"><i>recvmsg</i>()</a> with SCM_RIGHTS on a UNIX domain socket instead of using
<i>ioctl</i>() with I_SENDFD and I_RECVFD on a STREAM.</p>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_03_01_02" id="tag_22_03_01_02"></a>B.3.1.2 Tracing Option</h5>
<p class="tent">Applications are recommended to use implementation-provided extension interfaces instead of the functionality
provided by this option. (Such interfaces were in widespread use before the Tracing option was added to POSIX.1 and continued to be
used in preference to the Tracing option interfaces.)</p>
<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_22_03_01_03" id="tag_22_03_01_03"></a>B.3.1.3 _longjmp() and _setjmp()</h5>

<pre>
<tt>#define isascii(c) (((c) & ~0177) == 0)
#define toascii(c) ((c) & 0177)
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">An alternative replacement for <i>isascii</i>(), depending on the intended outcome if the code is ported to
implementations with different character encodings, might be:</p>
<pre>
<tt>#define isascii(c) (isprint((c)) || iscntrl((c)))
</tt></pre>
<p class="tent">(In the C or POSIX locale, this determines whether <i>c</i> is a character in the portable character set.)</p>

<h4><a name="tag_22_03_03" id="tag_22_03_03"></a>B.3.3 Examples for Spawn</h4>
<p class="tent">The following long examples are provided in the Rationale (Informative) volume of POSIX.1-2024 as a supplement to
the reference page for <a href="../functions/posix_spawn.html"><i>posix_spawn</i>()</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_22_03_03_01" id="tag_22_03_03_01"></a>Example Library Implementation of Spawn</h5>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/posix_spawn.html"><i>posix_spawn</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/posix_spawnp.html"><i>posix_spawnp</i>()</a> functions provide the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="tent">Simply start a process executing a process image. This is the simplest application for process creation, and it
may cover most executions of <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>.</li>
<li class="tent">Support I/O redirection, including pipes.</li>
<li class="tent">Run the child under a user and group ID in the domain of the parent.</li>
<li class="tent">Run the child at any priority in the domain of the parent.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tent">The <a href="../functions/posix_spawn.html"><i>posix_spawn</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/posix_spawnp.html"><i>posix_spawnp</i>()</a> functions do not cover every possible use of the <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> function, but they do span the common applications: typical use by a shell and a login
utility.</p>
<p class="tent">The price for an application is that before it calls <a href=
"../functions/posix_spawn.html"><i>posix_spawn</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/posix_spawnp.html"><i>posix_spawnp</i>()</a>, the
parent must adjust to a state that <a href="../functions/posix_spawn.html"><i>posix_spawn</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/posix_spawnp.html"><i>posix_spawnp</i>()</a> can map to the desired state for the child. Environment changes require
the parent to save some of its state and restore it afterwards. The example below demonstrates an initial approach to implementing
<a href="../functions/posix_spawn.html"><i>posix_spawn</i>()</a> using other POSIX operations, although an actual implementation
will need to be more robust at handling all possible filenames.</p>
