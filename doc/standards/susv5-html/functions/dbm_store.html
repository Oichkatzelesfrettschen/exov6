<blockquote>
<p>These functions create, access, and modify a database.</p>
<p>A <b>datum</b> consists of at least two members, <i>dptr</i> and <i>dsize</i>. The <i>dptr</i> member points to an object that
is <i>dsize</i> bytes in length. Arbitrary binary data, as well as character strings, may be stored in the object pointed to by
<i>dptr</i>.</p>
<p>A database shall be stored in one or two files. When one file is used, the name of the database file shall be formed by
appending the suffix <b>.db</b> to the <i>file</i> argument given to <i>dbm_open</i>(). When two files are used, the names of the
database files shall be formed by appending the suffixes <b>.dir</b> and <b>.pag</b> respectively to the <i>file</i> argument.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_open</i>() function shall open a database. The <i>file</i> argument to the function is the pathname of the database.
Values for the <i>open_flags</i> argument are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list, defined in
<a href="../basedefs/fcntl.h.html"><i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i></a>. Applications shall specify exactly one of the first three values
(file access modes) below in the value of <i>open_flags</i>:</p>
<dl compact>
<dd></dd>
<dt>O_RDONLY</dt>
<dd>Open the database, and the underlying file(s) used to store the database, for reading only.</dd>
<dt>O_RDWR</dt>
<dd>Open the database, and the underlying file(s) used to store the database, for reading and writing.</dd>
<dt>O_WRONLY</dt>
<dd>Open the database for writing only. The underlying file(s) used to store the database shall be opened for reading and
writing.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any combination of the following can be used:</p>
<dl compact>
<dd></dd>
<dt>O_CLOEXEC</dt>
<dd>If set, the FD_CLOEXEC flag for the new file descriptor(s) used to open the underlying file(s) shall be set.</dd>
<dt>O_CREAT</dt>
<dd>If the database exists, this flag has no effect except as noted under O_EXCL below. Otherwise, the database shall be created;
the user ID of the underlying file(s) shall be set to the effective user ID of the process; the group ID of the underlying file(s)
shall be set to the group ID of the file's parent directory or to the effective group ID of the process. Implementations shall
provide a way to initialize the group ID to the group ID of the parent directory. Implementations may, but need not, provide an
implementation-defined way to initialize the group ID to the effective group ID of the calling process.</dd>
<dt>O_DSYNC</dt>
<dd><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('SIO')">SIO</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
Write I/O operations on the file(s) used to store the database shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O data integrity
completion. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></dd>
<dt>O_EXCL</dt>
<dd>If O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set, <i>dbm_open</i>() shall fail if the database exists according to the following criteria. If the
database is stored in a file with a <b>.db</b> suffix, a check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it
does not exist shall be performed as a single atomic operation. If the database is stored in files with <b>.pag</b> and <b>.dir</b>
suffixes, this atomic existence check and creation operation shall be performed for each file, but it is unspecified which file is
first. If the first file is successfully created and the second file is found to exist, the first file should be removed before
<i>dbm_open</i>() returns.
<p>If O_EXCL is set and O_CREAT is not set, the result is undefined.</p>
</dd>
<dt>O_RSYNC</dt>
<dd><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('SIO')">SIO</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
Read I/O operations on the file(s) used to store the database shall complete at the same level of integrity as specified by the
O_DSYNC and O_SYNC flags. If both O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC are set in oflag, all I/O operations on the file(s) shall complete as defined
by synchronized I/O data integrity completion. If both O_SYNC and O_RSYNC are set in flags, all I/O operations on the file(s) shall
complete as defined by synchronized I/O file integrity completion. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border=
"0"></dd>
<dt>O_SYNC</dt>
<dd>Write I/O operations on the file(s) used to store the database shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O file integrity
completion.</dd>
<dt>O_TRUNC</dt>
<dd>If the database exists and is successfully opened O_RDWR or O_WRONLY, it shall be emptied, and the mode and owner of the
underlying file(s) shall be unchanged. The result of using O_TRUNC without either O_RDWR or O_WRONLY is undefined.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The behaviour of other flags described for the <i>flags</i> argument of <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> is
unspecified.</p>
<p>The <i>file_mode</i> argument has the same meaning as the third argument of <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>
and shall apply to the underlying file(s) used to store the database.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_open</i>() function need not accept pathnames longer than {PATH_MAX}-4 bytes (including the terminating null), or
pathnames with a last component longer than {NAME_MAX}-4 bytes (excluding the terminating null).</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_close</i>() function shall close a database. The application shall ensure that argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a
<b>dbm</b> structure that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().</p>
<p>These database functions shall support an internal block size large enough to support key/content pairs of at least 1023
bytes.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_fetch</i>() function shall read a record from a database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure
that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>(). The argument <i>key</i> is a <b>datum</b> that has been initialized by the
application to the value of the key that matches the key of the record the program is fetching.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_store</i>() function shall write a record to a database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure
that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>(). The argument <i>key</i> is a <b>datum</b> that has been initialized by the
application to the value of the key that identifies (for subsequent reading, writing, or deleting) the record the application is
writing. The argument <i>content</i> is a <b>datum</b> that has been initialized by the application to the value of the record the
program is writing. The argument <i>store_mode</i> controls whether <i>dbm_store</i>() replaces any pre-existing record that has
the same key that is specified by the <i>key</i> argument. The application shall set <i>store_mode</i> to either DBM_INSERT or
DBM_REPLACE. If the database contains a record that matches the <i>key</i> argument and <i>store_mode</i> is DBM_REPLACE, the
existing record shall be replaced with the new record. If the database contains a record that matches the <i>key</i> argument and
<i>store_mode</i> is DBM_INSERT, the existing record shall be left unchanged and the new record ignored. If the database does not
contain a record that matches the <i>key</i> argument and <i>store_mode</i> is either DBM_INSERT or DBM_REPLACE, the new record
shall be inserted in the database.</p>
<p>If the sum of a key/content pair exceeds the internal block size, the result is unspecified. Moreover, the application shall
ensure that all key/content pairs that hash together fit on a single block. The <i>dbm_store</i>() function shall return an error
in the event that a disk block fills with inseparable data.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_delete</i>() function shall delete a record and its key from the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a
database structure that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>(). The argument <i>key</i> is a <b>datum</b> that has been
initialized by the application to the value of the key that identifies the record the program is deleting.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() function shall return the first key in the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database
structure that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_nextkey</i>() function shall return the next key in the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database
structure that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>(). The application shall ensure that the <i>dbm_firstkey</i>()
function is called before calling <i>dbm_nextkey</i>(). Subsequent calls to <i>dbm_nextkey</i>() return the next key until all of
the keys in the database have been returned.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_error</i>() function shall return the error condition of the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a
database structure that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_clearerr</i>() function shall clear the error condition of the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a
database structure that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().</p>
<p>The <i>dptr</i> pointers returned by these functions may point into static storage that may be changed by subsequent calls.</p>
<p>These functions need not be thread-safe.</p>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_17_105_04" id="tag_17_105_04"></a>RETURN VALUE</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i>dbm_store</i>() and <i>dbm_delete</i>() functions shall return 0 when they succeed and a negative value when they
fail.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_store</i>() function shall return 1 if it is called with a <i>flags</i> value of DBM_INSERT and the function finds an
existing record with the same key.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_error</i>() function shall return 0 if the error condition is not set and return a non-zero value if the error
condition is set.</p>
<p>The return value of <i>dbm_clearerr</i>() is unspecified.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() and <i>dbm_nextkey</i>() functions shall return a key <b>datum</b>. When the end of the database is
reached, the <i>dptr</i> member of the key is a null pointer. If an error is detected, the <i>dptr</i> member of the key shall be a
null pointer and the error condition of the database shall be set.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_fetch</i>() function shall return a content <b>datum</b>. If no record in the database matches the key or if an error
condition has been detected in the database, the <i>dptr</i> member of the content shall be a null pointer.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_open</i>() function shall return a pointer to a database structure. If an error is detected during the operation,
<i>dbm_open</i>() shall return a (<b>DBM *</b>)0.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_17_105_07" id="tag_17_105_07"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The following code can be used to traverse the database:</p>
<pre>
<tt>for(key = dbm_firstkey(db); key.dptr != NULL; key = dbm_nextkey(db))
</tt></pre>
<p>The <i>dbm_</i>* functions provided in this library should not be confused in any way with those of a general-purpose database
management system. These functions do not provide for multiple search keys per entry, they do not protect against multi-user access
(in other words they do not lock records or files), and they do not provide the many other useful database functions that are found
in more robust database management systems. Creating and updating databases by use of these functions is relatively slow because of
data copies that occur upon hash collisions. These functions are useful for applications requiring fast lookup of relatively static
information that is to be indexed by a single key.</p>
<p>Note that a strictly conforming application is extremely limited by these functions: since there is no way to determine that the
keys in use do not all hash to the same value (although that would be rare), a strictly conforming application cannot be guaranteed
that it can store more than one block's worth of data in the database. As long as a key collision does not occur, additional data
may be stored, but because there is no way to determine whether an error is due to a key collision or some other error condition
(<a href="../functions/dbm_error.html"><i>dbm_error</i>()</a> being effectively a Boolean), once an error is detected, the
application is effectively limited to guessing what the error might be if it wishes to continue using these functions.</p>
<p>The <i>dbm_delete</i>() function need not physically reclaim file space, although it does make it available for reuse by the
database.</p>
<p>After calling <i>dbm_store</i>() or <i>dbm_delete</i>() during a pass through the keys by <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() and
<i>dbm_nextkey</i>(), the application should reset the database by calling <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() before again calling
<i>dbm_nextkey</i>(). The contents of these files are unspecified and may not be portable.</p>
<p>Applications should take care that database pathname arguments specified to <i>dbm_open</i>() are not prefixes of unrelated
files. This might be done, for example, by placing databases in a separate directory.</p>
<p>Since some implementations use three characters for a suffix and others use four characters for a suffix, applications should
ensure that the maximum portable pathname length passed to <i>dbm_open</i>() is no greater than {PATH_MAX}-4 bytes, with the last
component of the pathname no greater than {NAME_MAX}-4 bytes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_17_105_08" id="tag_17_105_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Previously the standard required the database to be stored in two files, one file being a directory containing a bitmap of keys
and having <b>.dir</b> as its suffix. The second file containing all data and having <b>.pag</b> as its suffix. This has been
changed not to specify the use of the files and to allow newer implementations of the Berkeley DB interface using a single file
that have evolved while remaining compatible with the application programming interface. The standard developers considered
removing the specific suffixes altogether but decided to retain them so as not to pollute the application file name space more than
necessary and to allow for portable backups of the database.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_17_105_09" id="tag_17_105_09"></a>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A future revision of this standard may mandate the file removal that is currently recommended (by the use of &quot;should&quot;) in the
description of O_EXCL.</p>
