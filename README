NOTE: MIT have stopped maintaining the x86 version of xv6, and switched
their efforts to the RISC-V version
(https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git)

This project experiments with decomposition of the xv6 operating system into an exokernel model. 

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

The user-level shell supports built-in commands such as ``cd``.  These
built-ins execute directly in the shell process even when used in command
lists, pipelines, or background jobs. Programs invoked by the shell are
searched for only in the root directory; if a command does not include a
slash, the shell automatically prefixes ``/`` before executing it. xv6
does not implement a ``PATH`` environment variable.

Programs are expected to reside directly under `/`.  If a command
name does not include a slash, the shell automatically prepends `/`
when searching for the executable.  xv6 does not support environment
variables like `PATH`, so the shell's search path is effectively hard
coded to just `/`.

ERROR REPORTS

We don't process error reports (see note on top of this file).

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
A cross-compiler may not be necessary on a 64-bit Linux host since the
toolchain can produce 32-bit binaries, but on other systems install a
cross-compiler suite and invoke ``make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-``.  Now
install the QEMU PC simulator and run ``make qemu``.  The Bochs
emulator is also supported via ``make bochs`` and is installed by
``setup.sh``.

BOCHS
-----
The file ``dot-bochsrc`` contains the default configuration used when
running ``make bochs``.  Severity directives such as ``panic:``,
``error:``, ``info:`` and ``debug:`` accept per-facility overrides after the
global ``action`` keyword.  These overrides let you customize how Bochs
reacts to events from individual subsystems.  Example::

    panic: action=ask, cdrom=report

This reports panics generated by the CD-ROM device while prompting for
all other panic events.  Valid actions include ``fatal``, ``report``,
``ignore`` and ``ask``.

Before building user-mode programs you must generate ``libos.a``,
the user-space runtime library.  This typically happens as an
implicit prerequisite, but if you see errors about a missing
``libos.a`` run ``make libos`` explicitly and then rebuild your
programs.
A helper script, `setup.sh`, installs cross-compilers, build dependencies,
QEMU packages, and additional development tools.  Run it once before
building to ensure all prerequisites are available.  From the top-level
directory simply execute::

    sudo ./setup.sh

This script installs bare-metal cross compiler packages such as
``gcc-i386-elf``/``g++-i386-elf`` and ``gcc-x86-64-elf``/``g++-x86-64-elf``
along with the rest of the toolchain.

This only needs to be done after cloning the repository or when
dependencies change.

The repository uses ``pre-commit`` hooks to automatically run
``clang-format`` and ``clang-tidy``.  The ``setup.sh`` script attempts to
install ``pre-commit`` via the distribution package manager and falls
back to Python's ``pip`` if required.  If ``pre-commit`` is missing you
can install it manually with::

    pip install pre-commit

Once installed, enable the hooks with::

    pre-commit install

    pre-commit run --all-files

The checks will run on every commit thereafter.

To validate patches before emailing them, enable the
``sendemail-validate`` hook::

    cp .git/hooks/sendemail-validate.sample .git/hooks/sendemail-validate
    chmod +x .git/hooks/sendemail-validate

A sample ``sendemail-validate`` hook is provided as
``scripts/sendemail-validate.sample``.  It runs spell checking,
``checkpatch.pl`` and a quick build in a temporary worktree before
patches are emailed.  Enable it with::

    cp scripts/sendemail-validate.sample .git/hooks/sendemail-validate
    chmod +x .git/hooks/sendemail-validate

``clang-tidy`` is wrapped by ``scripts/run-clang-tidy.sh`` which
generates ``compile_commands.json`` on demand using
``scripts/gen_compile_commands.py`` if it doesn't already exist.

Experimental support for building with the C23 standard and for
cross-compiling a 64-bit version is available. Set
``ARCH=x86_64`` when invoking make to enable 64-bit builds and adjust
``CSTD`` to use a different C standard if desired.


When building with ``ARCH=x86_64`` the resulting artifacts will be named
``kernel64``, ``fs64.img``, ``xv6-64.img`` and ``xv6memfs-64.img``.
Use these files when running QEMU or other emulators.

64-BIT BUILD REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------
Building a 64-bit kernel requires a cross-compiler capable of producing
``x86_64-elf`` binaries.  On most Linux systems this means installing
``x86_64-elf-gcc`` and the matching ``x86_64-elf`` binutils package.
If such packages are not available from your distribution you can build
them from source using the standard GNU build process.

Once a cross-compiler is installed, build the kernel with::

    make ARCH=x86_64

The resulting ``kernel.img`` can be run under QEMU with::

    make qemu ARCH=x86_64

The 64-bit port currently differs from the 32-bit version in a few
ways.  It is less thoroughly tested and some user-space tests may not
pass.  The memory layout also differs slightly in order to support 64-bit
addresses.

In 64-bit mode the kernel lives in the higher half of the address
space.  ``memlayout.h`` defines ``KERNBASE64`` at
``0xffffffff80000000`` with devices mapped near the top of the canonical
range starting at ``DEVSPACE64``.  ``PHYSTOP64`` specifies the upper
limit of usable physical memory.  When building for 64-bit these values
are selected automatically via conditional compilation and replace the
32-bit constants.


16-BIT BUILD
------------
An experimental 16-bit configuration is also available.  ``setup.sh``
installs the ``ia16-elf-gcc`` cross compiler.  Build the tiny 16-bit
kernel and run it under Bochs with::

    make ARCH=ia16
    make bochs ARCH=ia16

This creates ``kernel-ia16`` and ``xv6-ia16.img`` which Bochs can boot
in real mode.

CROSS-COMPILING
---------------
The ``setup.sh`` script installs cross-compilers for several
architectures such as ARMv7, AArch64, PowerPC and PowerPC64 (both
big-endian and little-endian).  Use the ``ARCH`` variable when invoking
``make`` to select the desired target.  The current Makefile implements
``ARCH=aarch64`` in addition to ``x86`` and ``x86_64``.

Build and run an AArch64 image with::

    make ARCH=aarch64
    ./qemu-aarch64.sh

Other cross-compilers are ready for experimentation.  Example commands
for architectures that do not yet have dedicated run scripts are::

    make ARCH=arm        # ARMv7
    qemu-system-arm -M virt -nographic -kernel kernel-arm

    make ARCH=powerpc    # 32-bit PowerPC
    qemu-system-ppc -M g3beige -nographic -kernel kernel-powerpc

    make ARCH=ppc64      # PowerPC64 big-endian
    qemu-system-ppc64 -M pseries -nographic -kernel kernel-ppc64

    make ARCH=ppc64le    # PowerPC64 little-endian
    qemu-system-ppc64 -M pseries -cpu POWER8 -nographic -kernel kernel-ppc64le

When additional ``ARCH`` values are implemented in the Makefile these
commands will build and boot the corresponding images.


BOCHS
-----
Logging actions in ``dot-bochsrc`` can now be tailored per facility.  A
default action may be followed by overrides for specific devices.  For
example::

    panic: action=ask, cdrom=report
    error: action=report, cdrom=ignore
    info:  action=report
    debug: action=ignore, cdrom=report

The above configuration reports panics from the CD-ROM while leaving
other devices interactive, ignores non-critical CD-ROM errors and still
prints its debug messages.

MESON BUILD
-----------
The repository also includes a simple Meson setup.  After running
``setup.sh`` the ``meson`` and ``ninja`` tools are installed.  Configure a
build directory and compile with::

    meson setup build
    ninja -C build

CODE FORMATTING
---------------
The project includes a ``.clang-format`` file configured for the LLVM
style with two-space indentation and the C23 language standard.  Before
submitting patches, run ``clang-format`` on any modified sources:

    clang-format -i file.c


EXO STREAMS
-----------
``struct exo_stream`` links scheduler modules together.  Register a stream
with ``exo_stream_register`` and call ``exo_stream_yield`` or
``exo_stream_halt`` to invoke the registered callbacks.  See the
``EXO_STREAM`` design note for details.  ``yield()`` invokes
``exo_stream_yield`` before scheduling another process.  When the
scheduler has no runnable tasks it calls ``exo_stream_halt`` rather
than spinning; the default implementation issues ``hlt`` if no stream
is registered.


USER DEMO: EXO_YIELD_TO AND STREAMS
-----------------------------------
The example program ``exo_stream_demo`` under ``src-uland/user/`` is a minimal
illustration of switching contexts with ``exo_yield_to`` and using the
placeholder STREAMS ``stop`` and ``yield`` calls.  Build the system as
usual with ``make``; the resulting ``fs.img`` will contain the new
``exo_stream_demo`` binary.  Run it inside QEMU to observe the stub
functions printing messages that indicate the expected invocation order.

USER DEMO: TYPED CHANNELS
-------------------------
``typed_chan_demo`` showcases the ``CHAN_DECLARE`` macro that creates a
typed wrapper around the basic capability IPC functions.  Messages are
defined using Cap'n Proto schemas under ``proto/`` and automatically
serialized when sending.  Building with ``make`` will compile
``typed_chan_demo`` along with ``typed_chan_send`` and
``typed_chan_recv`` under ``src-uland/user``.  After ``fs.img`` is
generated, run ``typed_chan_demo`` inside QEMU to see a Cap'n Proto
message sent and received through the typed channel API.

USER DEMO: CHANNELS, DAG SCHEDULER AND SUPERVISOR
-------------------------------------------------
``chan_dag_supervisor_demo`` combines typed channels, the DAG scheduler and
the supervisor helper.  Building the repository with ``make`` compiles the
demo and its helper ``typed_chan_recv``.  After booting with ``make qemu-nox``
run::

    $ chan_dag_supervisor_demo

It spawns ``typed_chan_recv`` via ``driver_spawn``, sends a typed ping
message, and yields through the DAG stream before exiting.

USER DEMO: SIMPLE DAG
---------------------
``dag_demo`` constructs a small weighted DAG using the user-space
scheduler helpers.  Running the demo prints the order nodes are executed
according to their weights and dependencies.


USER DEMO: BEATTY SCHEDULER
--------------------------
``beatty_demo`` exercises the kernel's Beatty scheduler and prints the
resulting task order. Build with ``make`` so the binary is placed in
``fs.img`` and run it inside QEMU:

    $ beatty_demo

USER DEMO: HELLO CHANNEL
------------------------
``hello_channel`` shows typed channels together with capability
borrowing. After ``make`` completes, boot with ``make qemu-nox`` and run:

    $ hello_channel

USER DEMO: CHANNELS, BEATTY SCHEDULER AND RCRS
----------------------------------------------
``chan_beatty_rcrs_demo`` combines typed channels with the Beatty
scheduler and relies on ``rcrs`` to restart the helper process if it
exits. Build the repository and execute the demo after booting:

    $ chan_beatty_rcrs_demo

USER DEMO: BEATTY AND DAG
-------------------------
``beatty_dag_demo`` composes the Beatty and DAG schedulers through a
combined exo stream. The demo prints how Beatty selects which task family
runs while the DAG scheduler walks the dependency graph for that family.
Build with ``make`` and run inside QEMU::

    $ beatty_dag_demo
DRIVER SUPERVISOR
-----------------
``rcrs`` is a small supervisor that keeps user-space drivers running.
It parses ``drivers.conf`` where each non-empty line lists a command
and arguments to execute.  Comment lines beginning with ``#`` are
ignored.  When a driver process exits the supervisor automatically
restarts it.  The configuration syntax and available flags are
documented in ``doc/rcrs.md``. Add the desired commands to
``drivers.conf`` and copy the file into the file system image so ``init``
can launch ``rcrs`` early during boot.

Example ``drivers.conf``::

    kbdserv
    pingdriver --timeout=60


IPC DESIGN NOTE
---------------
See ``IPC.md`` for an overview of the fast-path call, capability badges,
and the proposed endpoint and typed channel features.

ENDPOINTS
---------
Endpoints are lightweight message channels inspired by Mach ports and
seL4 endpoints.  Each endpoint maintains an internal queue of
``zipc_msg_t`` values.  The ``endpoint_send`` and ``endpoint_recv``
system calls enqueue and dequeue messages, with receivers sleeping until
a message is available.  This allows asynchronous waiting similar to the
channel primitives in those microkernels.

NUMA-AWARE ALLOCATOR
--------------------
The page allocator now keeps a separate free list per NUMA node.  A
process can request a preferred node with the ``set_numa_node`` system
call.  ``kalloc()`` first attempts to allocate from the preferred node
and falls back to the other nodes only when the local free list is
empty.



See doc/phoenixkernel.md for a design overview of the Phoenix exokernel
and step-by-step examples of capability allocation, typed channels and
driver management.  The document also outlines the planned BSD and SVR4
compatibility layers built on top of the libOS.

Example supervisor usage to manage drivers:

```
$ supervisor start blk_driver
... later ...
$ supervisor restart blk_driver
```

SWIFT EXAMPLE
-------------
A small Swift demo is available in the ``swift`` directory. The script
``swift/build_swift.sh`` compiles and runs ``hello.swift``.
Execute it from the repository root:

```
$ ./swift/build_swift.sh
```

It should print ``Hello, world!``.

FUZZING
-------
The repository includes a simple Swift libFuzzer harness in ``fuzz.swift``.
The helper script ``scripts/swift_fuzz.py`` compiles the harness and forwards
any arguments to the resulting fuzzer executable. A quick smoke test can be
run as follows:

```
$ python3 scripts/swift_fuzz.py -runs=1
```

Additional libFuzzer flags may be provided after the script name.

STREAMS STACK
-------------
The repository includes a detailed simulation of STREAMS modules.
The `streams_stack.dot` file describes the expanded module layout. Generate an updated image with Graphviz:

```
$ dot -Tpng streams_stack.dot -o stack.png
```

The resulting `stack.png` illustrates the module chain.

Run the latency harness with Python:

```
$ python3 scripts/simulate.py
```

Further work items related to the STREAMS prototype are tracked in
`TODO_STREAMS.md`.
