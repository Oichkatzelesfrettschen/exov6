#POSIX Compatibility Layer

FeuerBird exposes capabilities for blocks, pages and IPC endpoints.
The libOS translates these primitives into familiar POSIX file and
process abstractions.  Each open file stores the underlying block
capability and read/write requests issue disk operations on that block.
Process creation uses capability protected channels to the scheduler but
returns a traditional PID.  Networking calls are thin wrappers around
the host socket APIs.

## Implemented Interfaces
| Interface | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `libos_open` | Handles `O_CREAT`, `O_TRUNC` and `O_APPEND` and grows the descriptor table. |
| `libos_stat` | Returns dummy metadata from the virtual FS. |
| `libos_lseek` | Adjusts the in-memory file offset. |
| `libos_ftruncate` | Updates the virtual file size and errors on invalid descriptors. |
| `libos_mmap` / `libos_munmap` | Allocate and free memory using `malloc`. |
| Signal set operations | `libos_sig*set()` manipulate a bitmask type. |
| Process groups | Forward to the host's `getpgrp()` and `setpgid()` calls. |
| Socket APIs | Thin wrappers around standard Berkeley sockets. |
| `libos_sigaction` | Stores handlers in a table;
mask and flags are ignored.| | `libos_sigprocmask` |
    Maintains a simple process - local mask.| | `libos_killpg` |
    Forwards the signal to `sigsend` using the group as a PID.|
    | `libos_execve` | Accepts an `envp` array but ignores it.|
    | `libos_waitpid` | Provides the standard signature;
only the PID is returned.|

        These wrappers mirror the POSIX names where possible but
                are not fully featured
                    .They exist so portability layers can build against FeuerBird
                        without pulling in a real C library.

            ##Environment Variables

`libos_setenv()` stores a key /
            value pair in a small internal table.
`libos_getenv()` retrieves the value or
    returns `NULL` if the variable is unknown
            .Variables are not inherited across spawned processes
            .

        ##Locale Stubs

            Only stub implementations of the standard locale interfaces are
                available
            .Functions
                like `setlocale()` and `localeconv()` accept any input but
                                               always behave
                                                   as if the `"C"` locale is
                                                       active.The stubs exist so
                                                           that third -
                                           party code expecting these calls can
                                               link against the libOS without
                                                   pulling in a full C library.
