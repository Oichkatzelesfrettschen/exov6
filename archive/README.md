# Archive Directory

This directory contains legacy documentation files that have been superseded by the unified canonical documentation in the project root.

## üìã Archive Purpose

These files are preserved for historical reference and git history continuity. **All current project information is now consolidated in the root [README.md](../README.md).**

## üìÇ Archive Structure

### `legacy_documentation/`
Contains markdown files that were merged into the canonical README.md:
- Architecture documents
- Status reports  
- Build analysis files
- Implementation roadmaps
- Technical synthesis documents

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

**Do not reference files in this archive for current project information.**

Instead, refer to:
- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Canonical project documentation (PRIMARY)
- **[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)** - AI agent instructions
- **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** - Claude Code guidance  
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Development guidelines

## üîÑ Migration Process

These files were archived as part of the documentation unification process to:
1. Eliminate redundancy and conflicts
2. Create single source of truth
3. Improve maintainability
4. Preserve historical context
