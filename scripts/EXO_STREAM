The exo_stream interface links a chain of scheduler modules that the kernel
can consult when yielding or idling.  Each module provides optional ``yield``
and ``halt`` callbacks.  A stream is installed with ``exo_stream_register``
and later exercised via ``exo_stream_yield`` or ``exo_stream_halt``.  When
invoked these functions walk the list and call each callback in order.

Modules omit an operation by setting the callback to zero.  If no stream is
registered ``exo_stream_halt`` issues the ``hlt`` instruction and
``exo_stream_yield`` does nothing.
