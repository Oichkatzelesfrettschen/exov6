This repository contains assorted tools to help hacking on the code base. One of these tools can generate a visualization of header file dependencies.

## Regenerating the header dependency graph

The script `tools/header_graph.py` scans the `kernel/`, `include/` and related directories for `#include` directives and emits a [DOT](https://graphviz.org/) representation of the dependencies between files. To update the graph run:

```sh
python tools/header_graph.py -o doc/header_graph.dot
```

The resulting `doc/header_graph.dot` can be rendered with Graphviz's `dot` command or any compatible viewer.
