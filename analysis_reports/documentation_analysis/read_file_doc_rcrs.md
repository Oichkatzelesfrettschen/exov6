# rcrs Configuration

The `rcrs` supervisor reads `drivers.conf` to determine which user space
drivers to launch. Each non-empty line describes one driver and its
arguments. Lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments and ignored.

Optional flags can follow the command. The current flags are:

* `--timeout=<ticks>` or `--ping-timeout=<ticks>` – number of clock
  ticks to wait for a driver to respond to a ping before restarting it.
  If omitted, a default timeout twice the ping interval is used.
* `--ping-interval=<ticks>` – how often to ping the driver. Defaults to
  20 ticks if unspecified.
* `--max-restarts=<n>` – stop restarting the driver after it has been
  relaunched `n` times.

Example `drivers.conf`:

```
# launch the keyboard service with a slower ping
kbdserv --ping-interval=50

# network driver with a custom timeout and limited restarts
pingdriver --timeout=60 --max-restarts=3
```

The supervisor periodically prints a status report showing each driver's
process ID and how many times it has been restarted. This restart count is
tracked for each driver since the supervisor started and increases every time
`rcrs` relaunches the program.
