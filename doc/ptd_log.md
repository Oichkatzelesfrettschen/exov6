# Philosophical Technical Debt Log

This file tracks outstanding philosophical or conceptual debt in the
FeuerBird project. Unlike ordinary bugs, these entries capture open
questions or theoretical shortcuts that may influence future design
choices.

Each entry should include a date and a short description.

## Example

- **2024-04-27** â€“ Capability semantics around partial revocation remain
  unclear. Revisit once the permission model stabilizes.

Add new entries below this example as the project evolves.
